<h1 title="">LINDA CARLTON&rsquo;S
<br />HOLLYWOOD FLIGHT</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">A FLASH ON THE SCREEN</span></h2>
<p>A bright red sports-roadster, loaded to
overflowing with young people of both sexes,
turned in at the gate of the Carltons&rsquo; home in
Spring City and whizzed up the driveway to
the porch steps. As it stopped at the entrance,
Dorothy Crowley, who was Linda Carlton&rsquo;s
best friend, disentangled herself from the
group and jumped out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Miss Carlton!&rdquo; she called to the
middle-aged woman sitting on the porch. &ldquo;Any
news of the world&rsquo;s most famous aviatrix?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Linda?&rdquo; returned Miss Carlton,
smiling.</p>
<p>Dot nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. Have you heard from her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t, Dorothy. But then, I didn&rsquo;t
expect to. You know, of course, that Linda has
set her heart on taking some sort of flying position,
and she had several prospects to interview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s been gone a week!&rdquo; protested
Dot. &ldquo;This is the twenty-second of September.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but she expected to be gone a week.
She ought to be home some time today. If she
doesn&rsquo;t come, I think she will let me know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we miss her just fearfully,&rdquo; concluded
Dot. &ldquo;And we want to hear the very minute she
gets back. You know Ralph leaves for college
tomorrow, and he&rsquo;s all hot and bothered about
going off without even a good-bye from Linda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Carlton smiled at the mention of Ralph
Clavering&rsquo;s devotion to her niece. The young
man, whose father happened to be the wealthiest
citizen of Spring City, made no attempt to
keep his admiration for Linda a secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have her call you the minute she arrives.
At least&mdash;if she doesn&rsquo;t come home in an ambulance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Dot laughed at the absurdity of such a suggestion
and turned to go. In her haste she almost
bumped into a messenger-boy, who at that
very moment was coming up the porch steps
with a telegram.</p>
<p>Miss Carlton rose from her seat and stepped
forward excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m afraid something dreadful has happened!&rdquo;
she exclaimed, ominously.</p>
<p>Dot remained motionless, and even the young
people in the car grew silent. An awful tenseness
seemed to hang over the peaceful September
day, as Miss Carlton received the message
into her trembling hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s <i>for</i> Linda&mdash;not <i>from</i> her!&rdquo; she
cried in sudden relief. &ldquo;So she must be all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely were the words out of her mouth
when the drone of a motor attracted everybody&rsquo;s
attention to the skies. A plane&mdash;yes,
with the rotors that proclaimed it an autogiro&mdash;was
approaching from the west, until it
seemed to hover over the very house itself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;There she is!&rdquo; screamed Dot, joyously, and
in another moment the six young people in the
roadster had all jumped out and were racing
towards the field beyond the house, where Linda
always landed her plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Carlton,
grateful that once again the girl who had been
through so many catastrophes in her zeal for
flying would be safe on the ground.</p>
<p>Linking her arm with Dot&rsquo;s, she accompanied
the young people to the field beyond the house.</p>
<p>With the ease of a cat settling down to take
her nap, the Ladybug, Linda&rsquo;s famous autogiro,
descended to the earth, and the slender, pretty
girl in a flier&rsquo;s suit and helmet, climbed out of
the cockpit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darling!&rdquo; cried Dot, dashing forward for
the first embrace.</p>
<p>Linda tried to hug everybody at once, with
an especially tender caress for her Aunt Emily,
who had mothered her ever since she was a
baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you kidnapped?&rdquo; inquired Ralph
Clavering, the tall, good-looking young man
who considered Linda his special property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or in a burning house?&rdquo; suggested Kit Hulbert,
Ralph&rsquo;s married sister.</p>
<p>Linda shook her head laughingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just taking a good week&rsquo;s rest, I&rsquo;ll bet!&rdquo;
surmised long-legged Jim Valier, whose idea of
bliss was to sleep. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame you a bit,
Linda. A fellow can&rsquo;t get a decent nap with this
snappy bunch around, let alone a full night&rsquo;s
rest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re surely all right, dear?&rdquo; inquired
Miss Emily Carlton, anxiously. &ldquo;No bones
broken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Linda smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, and I had a most successful trip.
I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it later&mdash;if anything materializes,&rdquo;
she added, mysteriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to go to the movies,&rdquo; explained
Kit, as they all turned back towards the house.
&ldquo;Can you make it, Linda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you will give me fifteen minutes for
a shower, and five for a bite to eat,&rdquo; she replied.
&ldquo;And if Aunt Emily will come along
too,&rdquo; she added affectionately.</p>
<p>She made even better time than she had
promised, and inside of a quarter of an hour,
a different Linda Carlton came down the stairs.
Clad in a blue silk suit the color of her eyes,
her beautiful blond hair showing under her
turban, she looked more like a society girl than
the world&rsquo;s most famous aviatrix.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>In the meanwhile, Dot had gone into the
garage and brought out Linda&rsquo;s roadster, for
Ralph Clavering&rsquo;s car, elastic as it seemed to
be, could not be stretched to accommodate two
extra passengers. Since Miss Carlton had graciously
accepted their invitation, they wanted
her to be comfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you won&rsquo;t ride with me!&rdquo; complained
Ralph, as he watched Linda take her place at
the wheel of her own car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sit beside you in the movies,&rdquo; she
promised,</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you even take Dot away from us!&rdquo; protested
Jim Valier, pretending to be angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be glad of my space!&rdquo; returned Dot,
as she squeezed into Linda&rsquo;s car, between her
chum and Miss Carlton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll miss the wise-cracks,&rdquo; remarked
Ralph. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t say that you occupy much
room, Dot.&rdquo; He started his engine. &ldquo;Hurry
up, now, or we&rsquo;ll miss the news reel, and think
how ignorant we&rsquo;ll be!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>The theatre was already darkened when the
group entered ten minutes later, so they all
walked quietly, in order to make as little disturbance
as possible. Even Sara Wheeler, who
giggled on every occasion, managed to suppress
any outburst with her handkerchief.</p>
<p>But their good behavior lasted only a moment.
No sooner were they comfortably seated
than the most extraordinary piece of news was
flashed on the screen. As if the manager had
been waiting for the dramatic moment to make
his announcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;WORLD&rsquo;S MOST FAMOUS AVIATRIX
SIGNS CONTRACT WITH THE APEX
FILM CORPORATION!&rdquo; thundered the voice
of the announcer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if any other girl could be as famous as
you, Linda!&rdquo; whispered Dot resentfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
like to know who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words died on her lips as the actual picture
of the famous aviatrix was shown. Why&mdash;it
looked like&mdash;it must be&mdash;Linda herself!</p>
<p>The girl, in a flier&rsquo;s costume, smiled and
turned aside to sign a contract.</p>
<p>&ldquo;MISS LINDA CARLTON, THE FIRST
GIRL TO FLY FROM NEW YORK TO
PARIS ALONE, ACCEPTS PART IN
&lsquo;BRIDE OF THE AIR,&rsquo; A PICTURE NOW
BEING FILMED IN HOLLYWOOD,&rdquo; continued
the calm voice of the announcer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ve been!&rdquo; exclaimed
Dot, just a little bit hurt that Linda had kept
this a secret from her. They had shared all
their joys and secrets ever since their experiences
in the Okefenokee Swamp together, and
it did not seem possible that Linda would deliberately
shut her out of such an important
event. Besides, Linda had always refused to
go into the movies. Why the sudden change?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cagey thing!&rdquo; muttered Ralph, as
amazed at the revelation as Dot, and even more
hurt than the latter that he had been excluded
from her confidence.</p>
<p>Linda made no attempt to answer; she sat
rigid in her seat, staring at the screen with unseeing
eyes. The girl whom the announcer had
proclaimed to be Linda Carlton was tall and
slender, and in her flier&rsquo;s suit and helmet, had
resembled Linda to a remarkable degree. But
of course it wasn&rsquo;t Linda. Why, she hadn&rsquo;t
been near Hollywood!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true,&rdquo; she finally whispered to Dot.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s somebody else, posing for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Linda!&rdquo; returned Dot, unconvinced.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to play innocent!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make a stunning heroine, Linda,&rdquo;
whispered Kit, leaning over from her seat beside
Ralph. There was sincere admiration in
her tone.</p>
<p>Then the whole party grew excited, and all
talked at once, shooting questions at Linda
without any regard to the fact that they were
supposed to keep quiet. People around them
showed perceptible signs of annoyance, until
Ralph, sitting back in sullen silence, admonished
them all to keep still.</p>
<p>The talk subsided, and the crowd&rsquo;s attention
was diverted during the feature, but Linda did
not even see it. Inside she was seething at the
very idea of anything so preposterous. Usually
a peaceful girl, she felt as if she would like to
tear that impostor to pieces.</p>
<p>Yet there was no use trying to tell the young
people after the show that it wasn&rsquo;t true.
Hadn&rsquo;t Linda been away for a number of days,
on some mysterious errand connected with flying!
Didn&rsquo;t the girl look like her&mdash;why, they
were sure it was Linda! And they were thrilled,
too. It was great fun to have one of their own
group a famous actress, as well as a famous
aviatrix. All of them&mdash;except Dot and Ralph.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to stay at our house for supper,
Dot,&rdquo; urged Linda, as the other car drove off
after the show. &ldquo;Can you phone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; agreed her chum, wondering
what kind of explanation Linda was going
to make for her secrecy in the affair.</p>
<p>Neither girl mentioned it until they were inside
the Carltons&rsquo; house. They did not stop on
the porch, but followed Linda&rsquo;s Aunt Emily
into the living-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose your telegram was from Hollywood,
Linda?&rdquo; inquired Miss Carlton, as if to
lead up to the all-exciting topic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t, Aunt Emily,&rdquo; replied Linda,
decidedly. &ldquo;It was from Mr. Eckert&mdash;you remember,
the head of the Air School at St.
Louis, where I took my course?... He wanted
me to take a position teaching there this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that sounds very attractive, dear,&rdquo;
replied Miss Carlton. &ldquo;Safer and more dignified
than all this stunt flying you&rsquo;ll have to do
for the pictures.&rdquo; A look of distress passed
over her face.... &ldquo;Linda, I don&rsquo;t like your
accepting that contract without consulting
either me or your father,&rdquo; she added, gently.</p>
<p>Linda dropped into a chair with a groan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Please sit down, Aunt Emily&mdash;and Dot. I
have a lot to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not knowing what was coming next, they both
complied with her request.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you both always found me pretty
truthful?&rdquo; she asked, seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we have, dear,&rdquo; answered the
older woman, immediately. &ldquo;Nobody ever
doubts your word. But you never promised me
that you wouldn&rsquo;t go into the films. I never
asked you not to, for I thought you wouldn&rsquo;t
consider it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Aunt Emily, I wouldn&rsquo;t. And I <i>haven&rsquo;t</i>!
You and Dot must believe me. <i>That girl you
saw today impersonating me is a fake.</i> I never
signed a contract, with any picture producer,
and I haven&rsquo;t been near Hollywood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dot jumped to her feet joyfully, and, dashing
across the room, wound her arms about her
chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad, Linda!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>Miss Carlton breathed a long sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think of the impudence of that girl!&rdquo;
she exclaimed. &ldquo;To dare to do a thing like
that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;Expecting that she can get away with it!&rdquo;
added Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; announced Linda, her
eyes shining with indignation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
fly right out there and grab her by the collar&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Linda, I never heard you talk so!&rdquo;
remarked her aunt in amazement. &ldquo;Not even
when you were a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never had such occasion to do so before.
You know what Shakespeare says about stealing
your good name. That&rsquo;s just what that
girl&rsquo;s doing. Making me cheap. As if I were
in aviation for publicity, or for personal gain!
Oh, I&rsquo;m stirred up, all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you one bit, dear!&rdquo; agreed
Miss Carlton, soothingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are you going to do?&rdquo; demanded
Dot, realizing that Linda must have already
formulated a plan during that moving-picture
show. &ldquo;Going to wire the Corporation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo; she replied, emphatically.
&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How could they believe you?&rsquo;&rdquo; quoted
Dot, from the old song of &ldquo;The Girl from
Utah.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly! If all my own friends&mdash;Ralph, and
Kit and Jim and everybody&mdash;yes&mdash;even you
and Aunt Emily&mdash;actually thought I was fooling,
how could I convince a strange director by
merely sending a telegram? He&rsquo;d think I was
the impostor, of course, and their Linda was the
real thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s logical,&rdquo; admitted Miss Carlton.
&ldquo;But what can you do, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to fly right out to Hollywood tomorrow,
after I give the Ladybug a thorough
inspection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Carlton sighed, this time not in relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll be home only one night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help that, Aunt Emily. I must go.
I just have to. I&rsquo;ll stop and see Mr. Eckert at
St. Louis, on my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dot&rsquo;s eyes lighted up with sudden inspiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I go with you, Linda?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May you!&rdquo; Linda repeated. &ldquo;Oh, Dot,
would you? I&rsquo;d just love it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d feel safer,&rdquo; put in her Aunt Emily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s decided, then,&rdquo; announced Dot. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
thrilled to death!... Oh, Linda, think of seeing
Hollywood. The movies being made&mdash;and
the stars themselves! We&rsquo;ll have a marvellous
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be sure to take plenty of clothes,&rdquo; cautioned
Miss Carlton. &ldquo;You know how much
they dress out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll outshine Lilyan Tashman herself!&rdquo;
promised Linda, thankful that her aunt was not
raising any objection to the trip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to tell Ralph about it?&rdquo; inquired Dot,
as she rose to telephone to her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; returned Linda. &ldquo;He
wouldn&rsquo;t believe me. He&rsquo;d think I was going
back to complete my contract. No; he&rsquo;s peeved&mdash;let
him stay peeved. I&rsquo;d rather spend my
evening planning our trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flying comes first, as always,&rdquo; observed
Miss Carlton, in a resigned tone, as she, too,
left the room, to do her part in making the trip
comfortable for the two girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">A DANGEROUS LANDING</span></h2>
<p>Early after lunch the following afternoon&mdash;another
clear, bright fall day typical of late
September&mdash;Linda Carlton and her chum Dorothy
Crowley climbed into the Ladybug, ready
to take off for Los Angeles. Smiling and waving
good-bye to Miss Carlton and Mrs. Crowley,
who were standing on the side of the field,
Linda gave her the gun. The plane taxied only
a short distance, then with her nose headed upward,
she began to climb almost vertically. It
was a pretty, graceful take-off, and even Miss
Carlton, frightened as she was of planes, had to
admit that the autogiro seemed almost human.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to make St. Louis before dark,&rdquo;
said Linda, through the speaking-tube. &ldquo;I
know the way so well&mdash;I flew it so often when
I was going to the Air School.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; replied Dot. &ldquo;You and
Louise.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Louise Haydock had been Linda&rsquo;s inseparable
chum all through high school. Then, when
they had graduated, and Linda&rsquo;s father had
given the latter an Arrow Sport plane, the two
girls had spent a year at a ground school in St.
Louis. Louise&rsquo;s marriage to Ted Mackay had
finally separated them, for the Mackays went
to Kansas City to live. Ever since that time
Dot Crowley had shared in most of Linda&rsquo;s flying
adventures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rdquo; suggested Linda. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
send Lou a wire tonight, and plan to stop in
Kansas City tomorrow for lunch. I&rsquo;m wild to
see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; agreed Dot. &ldquo;If she and Ted
aren&rsquo;t off on some flying trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The autogiro soared up into the clear, tingling
air, colder above than it had been on the
ground, and the old exhilaration of flying took
possession of Linda and made her heart sing.
Poor people down there on the earth, looking
like ants crawling about on their humdrum
affairs, when she was flying joyously through
the heavens! Poor Aunt Emily, who would
never know the thrill of this higher, freer,
purer world!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Even her anger against this impostor was
temporarily forgotten. Nobody could be angry
long in the sky. And, no matter what happened
later, she and Dot were going to enjoy this trip
to the coast. It would be the experience of a
lifetime to an ordinary girl.</p>
<p>The motor continued to hum evenly and the
Ladybug averaged a hundred miles an hour.
Over rivers and valleys and flat country,
through Ohio, past Indiana, on to Illinois. The
sun was setting as the girls sighted the broad
waters of the Mississippi, and they knew that
their first goal was in sight.</p>
<p>A huge beacon light was already glowing,
guiding the fliers on their way to the airport,
and then on to the Air School. But Linda could
have found her way without any guide, even in
the fast increasing darkness.</p>
<p>Linda decreased her speed and hovered over
the field. Some of the attendants recognized the
famous Ladybug, and by the time the autogiro
descended to earth, quite a crowd had gathered
to greet her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Miss Carlton! We knew it was you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to see you back, Miss Carlton!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Linda and Dot jumped out and Linda spoke
to all her friends and asked them to put the
Ladybug away for the night, and to tell her
where to find Mr. Eckert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone home, but you can get him on the
telephone,&rdquo; answered one of the attendants,
writing the number down for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw you in the movies, Miss Carlton!&rdquo;
announced another. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t look half
pretty enough, though. But we&rsquo;re sure goin&rsquo; a
see that picture when it comes to town!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda frowned. She didn&rsquo;t want to take the
time to deny the false impression, but she certainly
did hate this sort of thing.</p>
<p>The girls found a taxi at once, and, leaving
their bigger box in the autogiro, they took out
an overnight bag and went to a hotel that had
been familiar to Linda during her year at St.
Louis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to be up against all
the time!&rdquo; she remarked, with distaste, as she
and Dot settled back in the taxi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean about the movies?&rdquo; questioned
her companion. &ldquo;I was wondering why you
didn&rsquo;t deny it right off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t time to go about the world denying
things. And it seems so useless. Until I
have proof, I mean. They wouldn&rsquo;t believe me
any more than the crowd at home did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re right. Oh, well, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s
worry. We can clear the whole thing up in no
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They reached the hotel, made an appointment
with Mr. Eckert over the telephone, and
changed their costumes for dinner. It was after
seven o&rsquo;clock when they sat down to the
table, and they did full justice to the meal.</p>
<p>Mr. Eckert&rsquo;s first remark when he greeted
Linda was practically the same as that of the
boys on the field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear you are going into the movies,
Linda,&rdquo; he said, trying to hide his disapproval.
&ldquo;If I had known that, I shouldn&rsquo;t have wasted
your time offering you this position at the
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a false rumor, Mr. Eckert,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t a rumor. It was a fact,&rdquo; he
persisted. &ldquo;Sam and Jeff told me they saw
your picture, signing the contract.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know. I saw it too. But it&rsquo;s a fake. Some
girl is impersonating me. For the sake of the
money, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elderly man leaned forward, staring incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really mean that, Linda?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my way to the coast now, to clear
it all up. Naturally, I&rsquo;m furious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t take over the contract yourself?&rdquo;
the man asked, with apparent satisfaction.
What a joy this girl was, he thought! She was
made for far greater things than moving-picture
acting. Hers was a name that ought to go
down in history, among the daring pioneers of
aviation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; she assured him. &ldquo;You
know, Mr. Eckert, that that sort of thing doesn&rsquo;t
appeal to me&mdash;publicity and acting&mdash;and all
that stuff. I&rsquo;m happiest when I&rsquo;m up in the
skies with nobody else but my chum&mdash;Miss
Crowley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I always thought,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;So I must say I was somewhat disappointed
in the news when I heard it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Linda smiled. Mr. Eckert had always understood
her, and admired her&mdash;not as Ralph Clavering
admired her, for her beauty and feminine
charm,&mdash;but for her knowledge and skill as a
flier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you might consider my proposition
after all?&rdquo; he inquired, hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed. If you are willing to make it
more or less temporary. I mean I could sign up
for the duration of one course&mdash;say until next
spring. The other offers I have had have all
been so far away, that I&rsquo;d rather accept yours,
so that I could fly home every week-end. My
aunt is practically alone, you see, for my
father&rsquo;s business is in New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s splendid, Linda!&rdquo; he cried, and he
proceeded to go into detail about the work that
he wanted her to teach. Dot sat back in her
chair, gazing out of the window, and vainly trying
to suppress a yawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, Mr. Eckert,&rdquo; remarked Linda,
when the former had finished his explanation,
&ldquo;that I may not be back in time to start when
the school opens. Would you be willing to wait
for me&mdash;till, say, the first of October? I ought
to be here by then, though you never can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words Dot sat up and laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;You surely can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she agreed, heartily.
&ldquo;We have a habit of not showing up when
we&rsquo;re expected, Mr. Eckert&mdash;when Linda goes
on her wild adventures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but this is different,&rdquo; put in Linda,
sincerely believing that there were no wild adventures
in store for her this time. &ldquo;Hollywood
isn&rsquo;t like the Okefenokee Swamp. It&rsquo;s the most
civilized spot in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t promised to stay in Hollywood,&rdquo;
Dot reminded her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; admitted Linda.</p>
<p>Mr. Eckert rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do, Linda,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach the class myself until the first of
October. Then, if you can&rsquo;t come, I&rsquo;ll get another
instructor. Is that all right with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; agreed the girl, delighted to have it
all settled, and at a salary that was by no means
small. For Linda Carlton was a drawing-card,
and Mr. Eckert knew that her name would bring
new students to the school, and add prestige
to the fine faculty which they already had.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>The last several days had been glorious
weather&mdash;too good to last, Linda knew&mdash;for
about the middle of September the fall rains
usually set in. So she was not surprised to
waken the following morning to find a dismal
downpour, and what was worse, a bad wind. It
was one of the equinoctial storms, so common
at that time of the year.</p>
<p>Dot looked dismayed, but she had no idea that
Linda would postpone the flight. For you
couldn&rsquo;t tell how long such a rain might last,
and time was important.</p>
<p>She watched Linda get into her flying-suit,
as if the mere matter of weather were nothing&mdash;all
just part of the day&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up, Dot. If we are to make Kansas
City by lunch time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K.,&rdquo; agreed the smaller girl, cheerfully.</p>
<p>They were back at the field by half-past seven,
ready to start.</p>
<p>But the field was horribly muddy. Other
planes had encountered severe difficulty in taking
off, and the attendants looked doubtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if you&rsquo;re not going after all,&rdquo; remarked
Sam, stepping close to the Ladybug,
as Linda started the rotor blades in motion.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beastly day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;My rotor blades are going to help me to
rise,&rdquo; she returned, gaily. &ldquo;Just watch &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two minutes later the autogiro left the rain-covered
field, and soared into the murky skies.
Almost immediately the ground and the landmarks
became invisible to the girls in the cockpits,
and the plane seemed to be wrapped in a
great gray blanket of clouds and rain. The wind
was blowing furiously, as if it were determined
to get the better of the gallant Ladybug, but the
rotor blades of the autogiro succeeded in keeping
her on an even keel. But she rocked furiously,
until Dot felt sure that she was going
to be seasick.</p>
<p>Linda&rsquo;s gas was growing a little low&mdash;plenty,
she felt sure, to get to Kansas City&mdash;but
not any to waste, so she was keeping low. But
she could not see anything, and she was thinking
that at times like these flying could even
be monotonous, when, all of a sudden, as if in
a hideous dream, she saw a nineteen-story
building rushing madly at her. Not that she
realized that it was exactly nineteen stories&mdash;indeed
it looked taller than that at the moment.
It was huge, too big to avoid, as it loomed
there in her path, like some tremendous, horrible
monster, shutting out everything else in
her sight, waiting to annihilate her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>In the seat ahead Dot suddenly let out a
sharp cry of terror, and Linda, realizing in a
flash that she could not hope to clear the building
now, pushed the joy-stick forward and
nosed the plane into a dive. What was she
heading for? A street, where she would dash
down on top of pedestrians and motor-cars,
killing others as well as herself and Dot?...
But no, the speed was reducing; she was right
over another office building&mdash;a shorter one,
only about six stories in height&mdash;with&mdash;oh, joy
of joys&mdash;a flat roof! As if she had planned it,
she selected her spot, banked the autogiro to
the left, cleared the wire fence around the edge,
and landed right in the center of the roof! Making
it look all the world as if she had planned
a demonstration.</p>
<p>With a grin of incredulity she turned exultantly
to Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Linda, you&rsquo;re priceless!&rdquo; shouted her chum.
&ldquo;Anybody&rsquo;d think it was a stunt for the
movies.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Linda frowned, and Dot was sorry the instant
the words were out of her mouth. She had
forgotten all about the reason for the flight, in
her excitement at this narrow escape.</p>
<p>At this moment half a dozen people appeared
on the fire-escape, and a freckle-faced youth of
about eighteen climbed immediately to the roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty neat!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Is it a
stunt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a life-saver,&rdquo; explained Dot. &ldquo;We
nearly crashed on top of that big office building
over there, and this one just loomed up in
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know what building this is?&rdquo; asked the
young man.</p>
<p>Linda shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a newspaper building! Biggest newspaper
in Kansas City!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard of a building made of newspapers,&rdquo;
returned Dot. &ldquo;Funny we didn&rsquo;t
crash through!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man grinned; his specialty was
wise-cracks. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a reporter,&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;My slogan&rsquo;s &lsquo;First on the spot, to get news
while it&rsquo;s hot.&rsquo;&mdash;so please give me your names
and addresses.&rdquo; He took out his notebook, prepared
to write.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Linda looked displeased, but Dot was equal
to the occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sallie Slocum and May Manton, from Toonerville,&rdquo;
she replied, briskly. &ldquo;Two society
buds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reporter solemnly wrote down the names.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toonerville&mdash;where&mdash;what state?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toonerville, Trolley,&rdquo; answered Dot, without
blinking an eyelash.</p>
<p>This time the young man didn&rsquo;t know
whether to smile or not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding me! That&rsquo;s a name in Fontaine
Fox&rsquo;s cartoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it is,&rdquo; agreed Dot. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a place,
just the same. Just write and ask Mr. Fox, if
you want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda, meanwhile, had been examining her
gas supply. It was sufficient to take them to
the suburbs, where Ted and Louise lived, and
she was anxious to be off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, May,&rdquo; she said to Dot, managing
with a great effort to keep her face straight.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re off&mdash;if the young man will be kind
enough to get out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>The reporter went back down the fire-escape,
and Linda took off, but as the girls flew away
they could distinguish faces peering at them
from every window in sight. After all, they had
afforded a pleasant diversion to a dull, work-a-day
world, and Linda was thankful that it
had all turned out so happily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how clever of you to think of giving
fictitious names, Dot,&rdquo; she said, through the
speaking-tube. &ldquo;Now if it gets into the papers,
Aunt Emily will never guess that it was my
Ladybug. It might worry her dreadfully if she
thought I was dropping out of the skies all the
time on top of office buildings. She&rsquo;s dreamt
about my being pinned on a church steeple,
dangling in mid-air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, without further mishap,
they landed at the Mackays&rsquo; field, and saw
Louise waiting for them with an umbrella.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darlings!&rdquo; she shouted, above the noise of
the engine and the rotors, and dashed across
the muddy field like the impulsive girl she had
always been. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just wild about this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda and Dot jumped out of the cockpits
and hugged her joyfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now come on in and get warm and dry,&rdquo;
said Louise. &ldquo;Pity we can&rsquo;t take the Ladybug
inside too. But Ted&rsquo;ll look after her comfort
when he gets home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Ted get home for lunch?&rdquo; asked
Linda. &ldquo;Oh, I hope he does, for I haven&rsquo;t seen
him in ages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, darling, he doesn&rsquo;t. But he gets home
for supper, and you two are going to stay all
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t, Lou&mdash;honestly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use arguing. You just have to.
Didn&rsquo;t my Ted save your life a couple of times
at least, Linda Carlton? Don&rsquo;t you owe him a
debt of gratitude?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda laughed; there was no use arguing
with Louise. After all, there was no great
hurry&mdash;and it was bad weather for flying. One
night more or less wouldn&rsquo;t make much difference,
she thought.</p>
<p>So the young people spent a pleasant afternoon
and evening together, talking aviation,
swapping stories and gossip, and laughing
heartily over the newspaper story about their
strange landing, which appeared on the front
page that night. Little did they think at the
time that Dot&rsquo;s prank was to cause them serious
trouble later!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">THE CROSS-COUNTRY FLIGHT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;How do you go from here?&rdquo; inquired
Louise the next morning at breakfast, which
had been arranged for seven o&rsquo;clock so that the
girls could make an early start. The skies were
still dark, and it was raining, but the wind had
died down, and with it the worst of the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From here to Wichita, and then on to Albuquerque
by tonight, I hope,&rdquo; replied Linda.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be following the regular air-line. I think
that is really the safest and best way. By tomorrow
night I expect to land at Los Angeles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have to cross Death Valley?&rdquo; asked
Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fly over it&mdash;not cross it,&rdquo; corrected Linda.
&ldquo;But that has no terrors for me. And we shall
miss the worst of the Rockies, following such
a southern course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take plenty of water and gas, in case you
come down in the desert!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;That reminds me, Ted,&rdquo; said Linda, turning
to the big, red-haired young man at the
head of the table. &ldquo;Did you fill my Ladybug
up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and gave her a hasty inspection, too,&rdquo;
he replied. &ldquo;She looks O.K. to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m not expecting any trouble,&rdquo; returned
Linda, for she had great confidence in
Ted Mackay&rsquo;s judgment and knowledge of
airplanes.</p>
<p>While Linda took time to call Miss Carlton
on the long distance telephone, Louise insisted
upon packing a lunch, and filling the thermos
bottles with water and coffee. For she had never
forgotten Linda&rsquo;s first long flight when they
had been stranded on a lonely prairie, far from
food and civilization, and how grateful they
had been then for the elaborate picnic lunch
with which their hostess had supplied them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a brick, Lou!&rdquo; Linda cried, as she
kissed her good-bye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to stop next week, on your way
home!&rdquo; Louise reminded her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>The Ladybug&rsquo;s engine roared, and she taxied
a short distance, soaring soon into the skies. To
her joy Linda found that flying conditions had
considerably improved since the previous day.
The storm was clearing, and up above the
clouds, the sun was shining. Linda&rsquo;s way lay
straight before her, and she flew on and on,
keeping a sharp watch all the time for other
planes, until the clouds beneath her had completely
dispersed. Passing over Kansas, she
left Wichita behind long before noon time, and
pressed on through the northern part of Oklahoma&mdash;into
Texas, the state in which her
father&rsquo;s ranch had been located, when she took
that daring night-flight for the surgeon who
saved his life. At last, by consulting her map,
she felt certain she had reached New Mexico.</p>
<p>Both girls had been so thrilled in watching
the country beneath them&mdash;so strangely different
from the East&mdash;that they had not realized
how late it was growing. Hunger finally drove
Dot to consult her watch. To her surprise she
found that it was after three o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s eat!&rdquo; she said to Linda, through the
tube. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m starved!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; shouted Linda, surveying dubiously
the ground beneath them, covered with
dry bushes. There wasn&rsquo;t a sign of civilization
or cultivation anywhere about, and she had no
desire to land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right here in the plane,&rdquo; returned Dot.
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t forgotten the lunch Lou packed
for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea! And we&rsquo;ll get to Albuquerque
all the sooner. Something tells me that we&rsquo;re
not far off&mdash;if my calculations are correct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can&rsquo;t be lost,&rdquo; replied Dot. &ldquo;For
we&rsquo;ve been following the beacon lights straight
along the way. O. K., then. I&rsquo;ll unpack. Thank
goodness Lou fixed a lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sandwiches and coffee were delicious,
and all the while Linda kept right on flying.
But it was still light when the spires and buildings
of Albuquerque loomed up in the distance.</p>
<p>They landed at the airport and went to a
hotel for the night, thankful that the day,
though uneventful, had passed so pleasantly,
and hopeful for clear weather to continue for
the rest of their journey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>The sun was shining brightly and the day was
already hot when the girls took off from Albuquerque
the following morning. For hours they
flew over this hot, dry plateau region, where
the water supply was scanty, and where they
could see, even from their height in the air, the
bare earth shining between the scattered
clumps of grasses and shrubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to miss the Grand Canyon,&rdquo; Linda
told Dot as they came down at a small airport
town in Arizona, to rest and get their lunch.
&ldquo;It lies up in the north-western part of the
state, you know, and if we follow the most direct
course to Los Angeles, we miss it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can fly over it on our way back,&rdquo;
suggested her companion. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have more
time to enjoy the scenery when we have settled
with this impostor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s just what I think. So long as we
get home before the first of October, I&rsquo;m a free
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They continued their flight without any interruptions
or disasters all that afternoon.
They left Arizona behind and crossed into the
great state of California, over the San Bernardino
Mountains, where the climate was lovely.
Orange groves blossomed everywhere, the air
was sweet and delicious; they felt a great envy
of the people who could always live in this beautiful
region. At last they reached the city of
Los Angeles, and spotted the new white city
hall, as it rose in its majestic splendor, gleaming
in the brilliancy of its electric lights.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good old Ladybug!&rdquo; exclaimed Dot, as the
autogiro came to the ground at the airport, and
she stiffly climbed out of the cockpit. &ldquo;Never
lets us down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always lets us down&mdash;when we want her
to,&rdquo; corrected Linda, laughingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to leave her here at the airport
while we go on to Hollywood?&rdquo; asked Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so. I&rsquo;ll have the mechanics give
her a thorough inspection in the meanwhile.
But I don&rsquo;t want to go tonight. Let&rsquo;s have a
good dinner and get some sleep and start out
fresh tomorrow morning. We&rsquo;ll have our box
taken with us this time, and dress for the occasion.
We don&rsquo;t want to look like hicks from a
small town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Linda turned to give her instructions
to an attendant, a strange young man strolled
up to the girls and stopped, evidently waiting
for an opportunity to speak to them. It was
growing dark, but the beacon searchlight at the
airport was bright enough for them to see him
perfectly. He looked at the autogiro, and then
peered almost rudely into the faces of the two
girls. Linda ignored him, but Dot was furious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, ladies,&rdquo; he said finally, &ldquo;but
aren&rsquo;t you the two girls who landed on the top
of that newspaper building in Kansas City?&mdash;Miss
Slocum and Miss Manton, I believe the
names were?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dot giggled. She couldn&rsquo;t deny the fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve been taking a cross-country
flight in this boat,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I have a
friend who is a reporter&mdash;he&rsquo;s around here
somewhere, for he stops here every day at the
airport for news&mdash;and he&rsquo;d like that story, if
you&rsquo;d give me a few facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want publicity,&rdquo; Dot said, immediately.
&ldquo;So please don&rsquo;t let him print anything
at all about us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; added Linda, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing
new in what we&rsquo;ve done. Girls fly all over the
country every day alone. It really doesn&rsquo;t
mean much more than driving a motor-car now-a-days.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right about that,&rdquo; agreed the attendant.
&ldquo;It was a stunt to fly the Atlantic
once, but now it seems rather common-place.
The first person to go from here to Australia
by plane will sure get a head-line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t expect to try that!&rdquo; returned Dot,
laughingly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a little too far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; remarked the stranger who
had looked so keenly at the girls, &ldquo;did you girls
know that Linda Carlton is here at Los Angeles&mdash;or
rather, at Hollywood? You remember her&mdash;the
first girl to fly from New York to Paris
alone?... She has a contract with the Apex
Film Corporation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda and Dot looked at each other in distress.
This was a fine situation indeed. What
could they say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Linda Carlton,&rdquo; the aviatrix
finally announced, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on! Your name&rsquo;s Sallie Slocum!&rdquo; insisted
the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; shrugged Linda, turning
to the attendant. &ldquo;Nevertheless, I want this
autogiro registered here as belonging to Linda
Carlton, of Spring City, Ohio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O. K., Miss,&rdquo; agreed the attendant, making
note of the fact.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Summoning a taxi, the girls stepped into it
and closed the door without even so much as
good-bye to the young man who had forced a
conversation with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What gets me,&rdquo; observed Dot, &ldquo;is the way
reporters seem to bob up anywhere and everywhere&mdash;just
when they&rsquo;re not wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, but they have to get news, I suppose.
And it was really my fault in the first place,
for landing on a newspaper building. I would
have to pick that out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, who cares?&rdquo; returned Dot. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll
blow over, and be forgotten.... What hotel
are we going to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ambassador. I&rsquo;ve heard so much about
their &lsquo;Cocoanut Grove&rsquo; that I want to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later the taxi stopped at the
luxurious hotel, and the girls secured a room.
They engaged it for only a couple of days, little
thinking that they would have to remain in Los
Angeles for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>It was lots of fun to dress in evening gowns
and sweep into the dining-room as if they were
actresses. Even Linda admitted that she enjoyed
taking off her flier&rsquo;s suit at times, and
just being a &ldquo;regular girl.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;For tonight we&rsquo;ll be absolutely care-free,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;As if we hadn&rsquo;t a thing to worry
about!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which we really haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; added Dot.</p>
<p>They ordered an elaborate dinner and ate
slowly, watching the people in the dining-room,
hoping to catch a glimpse of a famous star or a
celebrated flier. But if there were actors and
actresses there, neither Linda nor Dot recognized
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish there were a &lsquo;first-night&rsquo; performance
that we could attend,&rdquo; remarked Dot,
when, after dinner, they summoned a taxi to
go to a moving-picture show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it would be nice. But then, we probably
couldn&rsquo;t get in, anyhow. Unless I pretended
to be the Linda Carlton who is in &lsquo;Bride
of the Air&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dot laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be a mix-up. The other girl
doubling for you&mdash;and then your pretending to
be the other girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds kind of like &lsquo;Alice in Wonderland&rsquo;
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>In spite of the fact, however, that nothing unusual
happened, the girls spent a pleasant evening,
and were glad of the chance to get to bed
early.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For,&rdquo; remarked Linda, as she undressed in
the charming bedroom, &ldquo;I am tired, even
though we didn&rsquo;t break any records crossing
the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was fast enough for me,&rdquo; agreed Dot.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather rest now and then, than dash off
like Frank Hawks. And when you compare it
to the way they used to cross the United States,
it&rsquo;s no less than miraculous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; yawned Linda. &ldquo;What was it that
that movie said&mdash;twenty-four days in 1850?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that was it, I think. Only I&rsquo;m too
sleepy to remember much now.... Wake me
up early tomorrow, Linda. For it&rsquo;s HOLLYWOOD!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">HOLLYWOOD</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly seems queer to be riding along
the ground,&rdquo; remarked Linda, as she and Dot
stepped into a bus for Hollywood the following
morning. &ldquo;But we can see so much more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s only eleven miles,&rdquo; Dot reminded
her. &ldquo;Oh, aren&rsquo;t you thrilled, Linda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am. What girl wouldn&rsquo;t be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they offer you the contract now, won&rsquo;t
you change your mind and go into pictures?&rdquo;
inquired Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the famous aviatrix, decidedly.
&ldquo;I love the movies, and of course I&rsquo;m keen to
see the stars face to face, but I still haven&rsquo;t the
slightest desire to act. I guess I&rsquo;m too shy. I
get so fussed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;ll be kind of a mean trick to haul that
girl out of the picture after the Film Corporation
have advertised it, and then not take her
place. The producer may lose a lot of money.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s his fault. They should have been
more careful about looking up her credentials.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you can&rsquo;t convince them that
you&rsquo;re the real Linda Carlton?&rdquo; suggested Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to stay there till I do. But I have
my licenses with me. I only wish I had my Distinguished
Flying Cross, but unfortunately
Daddy put it away in his safe-deposit box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bus was luxurious and the girls settled
down in delighted comfort. All the other passengers
looked prosperous and well dressed;
from their appearance they might easily be
moving-picture stars. But of course they
weren&rsquo;t, the girls decided, for even the humblest
star has her own car.</p>
<p>The country through which they were travelling
was lovely, and as they approached Hollywood,
the girls noticed charming, well-kept
bungalows and homes of every description. As
if everyone who lived there were wealthy. The
fresh green lawns, the tall palm trees shading
the streets, the vivid blue sky above formed a
striking picture. No wonder most girls were
wild to go to Hollywood!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Linda and Dot went on to Culver City, where
most of the studios were located, and found the
Apex Film Corporation, housed in a large and
imposing building. As they ascended the steps
Linda became exceedingly nervous, almost to
the point of wishing that she hadn&rsquo;t come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose they take us for extras&mdash;applying
for jobs&mdash;and throw us out!&rdquo; she whispered,
fearfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, Linda! Your name would get
you in anywhere!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure of that. We fliers aren&rsquo;t
much here, where they have a world of their
own and so many celebrities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls walked through a hall to a beautiful
reception room, where a &ldquo;publicity&rdquo; girl,
who looked like an actress herself, took Linda&rsquo;s
card and passed into an office to the right.</p>
<p>In a moment she returned with the information
that the girls might go into the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Von Goss is out, but his secretary will
see you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mr. Leslie Sprague.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do the talking, Dot,&rdquo; begged Linda, as
they left the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be yourself!&rdquo; commanded her companion.
&ldquo;You can fly over the Atlantic Ocean alone, and
you&rsquo;re afraid of an insignificant little secretary!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Linda laughed. What would she ever do without
Dot to restore her courage whenever a fit
of shyness overtook her? Holding her head
high, she marched into the office where the secretary
was sitting.</p>
<p>The latter, a young man of medium height,
with a blond moustache, stood up as the girls
entered. He opened his mouth to speak&mdash;but
continued to keep it open without saying anything
for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some mistake,&rdquo; he finally managed
to stammer.</p>
<p>Linda laughed, quite at ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a <i>big</i> mistake,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;And your director, Mr. Von Goss, I believe
his name is, has made it. I am the real Linda
Carlton, and he has signed up an impostor for
the flying part in his picture!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A slight sneer spread over the young man&rsquo;s
features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you have proof, Miss&mdash;er&mdash;?&rdquo; he
asked in a tone that plainly showed that he did
not suppose anything of the sort. How nasty
he was, not even to call Linda &ldquo;Miss Carlton&rdquo;
and at least give her the benefit of the doubt!</p>
<p>Dot&rsquo;s chin shot up in the air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose we&rsquo;d come here, without
some proof, do you, Mr. Sprague?&rdquo; she demanded,
haughtily. &ldquo;Miss Carlton is a very
busy person, as you&rsquo;d know if you read the
newspapers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man flushed at Dot&rsquo;s high-handed manner;
he was not used to being rebuked by
others. Little as she was, Dot Crowley had a
masterful way of driving straight at the mark.</p>
<p>Linda opened her handbag and held out her
licenses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just have these verified,&rdquo; she said, calmly.</p>
<p>The young man stared at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get hold of these?&rdquo; he asked,
slyly. &ldquo;Find Miss Carlton&rsquo;s handbag?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda made no reply, but turned her face
aside in haughty disdain, as Sprague rang a
bell and summoned a young woman from another
office, to whom he made a slight explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he continued after the girl had
left with the cards, &ldquo;what do you propose to
do about it&mdash;if your identity should be established?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;Simply have proof that you will remove my
name from the pictures, and print a statement
saying that you had been misled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sprague smiled sarcastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want the part yourself, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; replied Linda, firmly. &ldquo;I have
neither time nor inclination to go into the moving
pictures. Your actress can play the part&mdash;under
her own name, whatever it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Von Goss would never consent to that.
The girl isn&rsquo;t much of an actress. He just engaged
her for the value of the publicity. And,
if she should prove to be an impostor, I&rsquo;m sure
he wouldn&rsquo;t want her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s not my affair,&rdquo; concluded
Linda, rising. &ldquo;Please get my licenses back for
me now, Mr. Sprague, and when you have proof,
Mr. Von Goss can communicate with me at the
Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute&mdash;wait a minute,&rdquo; cautioned
Sprague, smugly. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t verify that license
in five minutes. The other girl also had licenses
in the name of Miss Linda Carlton, and the two
will have to be compared, in order to find out
which is a counterfeit!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s ridiculous!&rdquo; exclaimed Dot.
&ldquo;People can&rsquo;t counterfeit U. S. Government
licenses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The secretary smiled in his superior manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Real counterfeiters can counterfeit anything,&rdquo;
he informed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let me have mine back until we can
place them side by side with this other girl&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
demanded Linda.</p>
<p>Sprague shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, madam, but it&rsquo;s too late to do
that now. They have already been handed over
to our private detective, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How soon will he give them back?&rdquo; asked
Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow, probably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is this double of mine?&rdquo; questioned
Linda, with astonishing directness. &ldquo;On the
lot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. She&rsquo;s at Spring City now&mdash;or rather,
on her way to the coast. She&rsquo;s due here tomorrow
afternoon, flying into the Los Angeles airport,
to begin her part in the rehearsals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be there to meet her,&rdquo; announced
Linda, with determination. &ldquo;What time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three o&rsquo;clock. I&rsquo;ll&mdash;meet you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Reluctantly the girls left the building, for
they hated to go without the licenses, and
walked out into the bright sunshine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pest that man is!&rdquo; exclaimed Dot.
&ldquo;Of all the smug, self-satisfied, little tin-gods,
he&rsquo;s the worst I ever met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was rather unpleasant,&rdquo; agreed Linda.
&ldquo;But he probably likes the false Linda, and believes
in her. So he treats us as criminals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s it. But he didn&rsquo;t have to
be so nasty about it. And the ridiculous way he
tried to trip you up, asking where you got hold
of Miss Carlton&rsquo;s licenses. It made my blood
boil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not worth getting excited over, Dot,
for after all, it will be Mr. Von Goss who will
decide the thing. Let&rsquo;s forget him now, and go
to one of these spiffy restaurants for lunch.
Don&rsquo;t you hope we see some of the stars?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>They sauntered along leisurely, looking at the
people they passed, wondering whether they
were actors and actresses. But it was confusing,
for every girl here seemed to be pretty, and
every man handsome. Indeed, the stenographers
and waitresses were no doubt girls who
had won beauty contests at home, only to come
to Hollywood to find that beauty was as common
as blades of grass, and that there was more
to getting into the films than that. But of
course these girls with the jobs&mdash;any jobs&mdash;were
the lucky ones. Thousands of others must
have returned home penniless.</p>
<p>The restaurant Linda and Dot selected was a
charming one, not far from several of the
studios, and the girls entered it with subdued
excitement. Although it was crowded, the head
waiter succeeded in finding them a little table
by the wall, where they could eat and watch
their fellow-diners.</p>
<p>For a few minutes, while they sipped their
tomato cocktails, their eyes wandered about the
softly lighted room, recognizing nobody in particular.
Then, all of a sudden, Dot pinched
Linda&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Joan Crawford!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over there&mdash;to the left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That girl with glasses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. She wears them a lot in public, they
say, so that people won&rsquo;t recognize her. But
I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s she. And there&rsquo;s her husband, sitting
down beside her now. Anybody&rsquo;d know
him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Linda nodded, and feasted her eyes on one of
Hollywood&rsquo;s most celebrated and charming
couples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here comes Marlene Dietrich!&rdquo; exclaimed
Linda. &ldquo;With that director she&rsquo;s so
fond of. She is pretty, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, only I like our own actresses better
than those foreigners. They always seem so
affected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about Claudette Colbert? You like
her, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Linda, jealously. She
had a great admiration for the French ever
since her delightful reception in Paris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course.... Oh, look, Linda&mdash;there&rsquo;s
Dimples!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dimples? You mean June Collyer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Stupid! A masculine Dimples. Gable,
of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is! Wouldn&rsquo;t Sara Wheeler be
thrilled if she were here? She&rsquo;s wild about
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard he was getting a divorce. If you
stayed around here, Linda, and took that part,
you might have a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;The last thing I&rsquo;d ever want to do is marry
a movie actor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right at that,&rdquo; agreed Dot,
sensibly. &ldquo;Their marriages don&rsquo;t often take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls made their lunch last as long as
they could, and when they had finished they decided
to go to a movie. For although Hollywood
is the town where they make pictures,
they also have many gorgeous picture palaces.
Both Linda and Dot felt proud to know that
they were having first chance at seeing a show
which their friends in Spring City probably
could not view until many months later.</p>
<p>After the performance was over they took
the bus back to Los Angeles and went straight
to their room to dress elaborately for dinner.
They were almost ready when the telephone on
the tiny table between their beds jingled impatiently.</p>
<p>It was Mr. Von Goss, the director of the Apex
Film Corporation, the man whom they had
hoped to see instead of that unpleasant secretary.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;May I come over and see you right after
dinner, Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Carlton?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;Sprague has just told me the news, and I
want to learn all I can about it at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; agreed Linda. &ldquo;I shall be glad
to see you as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda replaced the receiver and turned to
Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what I&rsquo;ve been thinking? This
girl can&rsquo;t look exactly like me, or Mr. Sprague
wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed the difference at once.
Instead, he&rsquo;d have greeted me more like a
friend. But you remember&mdash;he opened his
mouth in surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Of course we couldn&rsquo;t judge
much from her picture, with that helmet on.
She was your build and your type, Linda. Light
curly hair, and the same kind of nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dying to see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I. But we shall tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Linda, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s going to be
interesting to get Mr. Von Goss&rsquo;s reaction. At
any rate, he was a lot more polite over the telephone
than his secretary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man arrived about nine o&rsquo;clock, and
Linda heard herself being paged just as she
and Dot came out of the dining-room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t I better slip off?&rdquo; suggested the
latter, in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo; protested Linda. &ldquo;I need
your moral support.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Von Goss was a stout man of past middle-age,
heavy set, with a big jaw and a pair of
keen blue eyes&mdash;obviously a man of power in
his own field. Nevertheless, he looked thoroughly
disturbed over the matter which had
just been brought to his attention by his secretary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You claim to be Miss Carlton?&rdquo; he inquired,
as Linda came up to him in the hotel lobby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Linda. &ldquo;And this is my
friend, Miss Crowley. Shall we go into one of
those little parlors where we can talk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The director nodded, and Linda led the way
into a small room that was unoccupied at the
moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er&mdash;will you have a cigarette, Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Carlton?&rdquo;
he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; answered Linda. &ldquo;But
you go ahead and smoke, Mr. Von Goss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man lighted a cigar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is bad business,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If what
you claim is true, and we have signed up the
wrong young lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are satisfied with my proofs?&rdquo; asked
Linda, hoping that he had brought back her
licenses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell yet. The other girl certainly looks
like all the newspaper pictures I&rsquo;ve ever seen
of the famous aviatrix. If she isn&rsquo;t Linda Carlton,
she certainly fooled me&mdash;and my secretary,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I look like my pictures?&rdquo; inquired
Linda, demurely.</p>
<p>Mr. Von Goss surveyed her critically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so much as the other girl,&rdquo; he replied,
with a smile. &ldquo;But of course you&rsquo;re in evening
dress, and the other girl always wears flying
suits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would,&rdquo; put in Dot, cryptically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, as Mr. Sprague suggested,&rdquo; added
Mr. Von Goss, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s the possibility that the
real Miss Carlton&rsquo;s licenses were stolen&mdash;and
that by you&mdash;or anyone else!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that Mr. Sprague!&rdquo; exclaimed Dot,
with the utmost disdain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are two things to do,&rdquo; announced
Linda, who had already come to a definite conclusion.
&ldquo;Get the two of us together, and have
some one who knows us in aviation pick out
the real Linda Carlton&mdash;or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mr. Sprague, and some fliers he knows,
have already identified our Miss Carlton,&rdquo; interrupted
the director. &ldquo;It was Sprague who
looked her up, and brought her into the production.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have to resort to the only other
suggestion I have, if you can&rsquo;t decide on our
license cards.... It so happens that I am the
only woman in the United States to hold an airplane
mechanic&rsquo;s license.... Now, my cards
could be stolen, but not my knowledge. So my
idea is this: Have some good airplane mechanic
give us both an examination, and only the real
Linda Carlton will pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The director smiled broadly at the suggestion.
It was an ingenious plan, and it appealed
to his sense of the dramatic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you, Miss Carlton. I think you
must be the right girl, or you would never make
such a suggestion. We&rsquo;ll try the thing out tomorrow.
When the other girl arrives at two
o&rsquo;clock, as she wired, I&rsquo;ll take you to the airport
to meet her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;Two o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo; repeated Linda. &ldquo;But Mr.
Sprague said &lsquo;Three&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have made a mistake. He told me
two.... Now, how would you girls like to go
to a reception with me? One of the stars is giving
a house-warming at her new place at Beverly
Hills, and I think I can ring you in on it,
if you&rsquo;d care about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d love it!&rdquo; cried Dot, jumping up excitedly.
&ldquo;But please wait until we put on our
very best dresses, Mr. Von Goss.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">THE VANISHING &ldquo;DOUBLE&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>The home of the star where the reception
was held was the most gorgeous place that
Linda and Dot had ever seen. It was more like
a palace than a home&mdash;out in the rich, exclusive
Beverly Hills section, among those of other
famous actors and actresses whose salaries
soared into the thousands. Compared to it, the
Claverings seemed almost paupers, yet they
were the wealthiest people Linda had ever
known.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like a fairy-tale,&rdquo; whispered Dot,
as the girls left their evening cloaks in a beautiful
blue satin boudoir. &ldquo;But what is there for
a girl like this to look forward to? Why, she
has everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost too much,&rdquo; said Linda.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;But her fame probably won&rsquo;t last more than
ten years at the most. I read somewhere that
even that is a long time for an actress. After
that she has to take character parts, and &lsquo;what
have you&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That seems tragic&mdash;giving up what you like
to do best. I expect to fly till I die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what your Aunt Emily says&mdash;only
she means it differently. That you&rsquo;ll meet
your death in the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda laughed, and she and Dot hastened to
join Mr. Von Goss, who was waiting for them
at the foot of the marble staircase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sort of feel as if we were butting in,&rdquo;
whispered Linda. &ldquo;Do I look terribly countrified&mdash;or
small-townish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, you&rsquo;re as pretty as any star here,
and lots prettier than some,&rdquo; replied Dot, reassuringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you surely look sweet in that peach
chiffon, Dot. You look like Paris itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do!&rdquo; laughed the other girl.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to have any inferiority complex.
And don&rsquo;t you, either, Linda!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Taking them into his charge, Mr. Von Goss
led the girls about the luxurious rooms, introducing
Linda to everybody as the most famous
girl flier in the world. It was evident from his
manner that he was entirely convinced that she
was the real Linda.</p>
<p>The effect of the reception as a whole was
startling, overpowering. Linda felt almost as
if she wanted to gasp for breath, so overcome
was she by the brilliancy of it all. It was only
when she met Ann Harding, her favorite
actress, that she really felt at home.</p>
<p>Miss Harding was amazingly beautiful&mdash;far
lovelier than she seemed on the screen, if such
a thing were possible. Her rich, low voice was
charming, her complexion perfect, her golden
hair like the pictures of a fairy queen. Yet
there was something sad in her beautiful brown
eyes. She and her husband had recently parted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am so thrilled to meet you, Linda
Carlton!&rdquo; she said, holding Linda&rsquo;s hand in
hers. &ldquo;I am only an amateur flier, but I love it
so. And I have read about every single thing
you have ever done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda blushed deeply at the praise; she
wished she could summon courage to tell Miss
Harding that she was her favorite star, but she
was too shy to utter the words. She was afraid
it might sound like idle flattery, thought up on
the spur of the moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Dot, however, came to her rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Linda&rsquo;s favorite actress, Miss
Harding,&rdquo; she announced, calmly. &ldquo;She goes
to see all your pictures&mdash;two or three times.
Especially the one where you played a character
named &lsquo;Linda.&rsquo; Do you remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do,&rdquo; replied Miss Harding. &ldquo;And
I loved that part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three girls sat down in a corner and actually
were able to talk flying without any interruption
for about ten minutes. Then someone
came to claim Miss Harding, and Mr. Von
Goss appeared for his protegees.</p>
<p>Nothing was said, during the entire reception,
of the trouble Linda was in, or of the fact
that another girl was actually playing her part.
The director had asked the girls not to mention
the fact, and they were glad to accede to his
wishes.</p>
<p>He took them to another room, a spacious
hall with a beautiful shiny floor and a marvellous
orchestra, and introduced some younger
men to them, so that they could enjoy the dancing.
Then a sumptuous supper was served, and
the party broke up before midnight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought the reception would be over
so early, Mr. Von Goss,&rdquo; remarked Dot, as the
director drove the girls back to their hotel in
his car. &ldquo;I always thought Hollywood went in
for wild parties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. If anything, the stars keep earlier
hours than ordinary people. Many of them have
to be on location early in the morning, and their
work is long and tiring. All the considerate
hostesses arrange for their parties to be early
affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more mistaken idea shot to pieces,&rdquo;
laughed Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a marvellous time, Mr. Von
Goss,&rdquo; said Linda, as the car stopped at the
Ambassador. &ldquo;We never can thank you enough.
And I&rsquo;m so glad we could go tonight, for we&rsquo;ll
probably be flying home tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure we can clear things up by
then. But I hope so. At any rate, I&rsquo;ll meet you
both at the airport at two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>The girls said good night to Mr. Von Goss
and went to their room, but they found that
they were not sleepy. The party had been too
exciting to settle down and forget it so soon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does kind of get into your blood,&rdquo; remarked
Linda, as she took off her most elaborate
evening gown. &ldquo;All the rush and splendor
and excitement, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weakening?&rdquo; teased Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean go into pictures myself, if I had
the chance? No&mdash;never! Why, you can&rsquo;t tell
me Ann Harding&rsquo;s happy. Or Joan Crawford....
No, it&rsquo;s not satisfying, like flying. I know
what I love best, and I mean to stick to it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wise girl!&rdquo; was the comment. &ldquo;But you
surely have Mr. Von Goss worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder. He says he advanced that other
girl fifteen thousand dollars, just for the use of
my name, and he&rsquo;s already spent at least a
hundred thousand on the story and the sets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems as if you just couldn&rsquo;t let him
down, Linda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not letting him down. I never made any
promises to him. He&rsquo;s being let down because
he was so careless.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>For at least an hour the girls continued to
discuss the party and the stars, until at last
they settled down to sleep, thankful that they
had no need to get up early in the morning.</p>
<p>They combined breakfast and lunch the following
day at noon, and went to the flying field
a little before two o&rsquo;clock to be on hand when
the false Linda should arrive.</p>
<p>Linda was intensely excited. She tried over
and over to picture to herself what this meeting
would be like, whether the girl would be
humble and sorry, whether she would try to
work on Linda&rsquo;s sympathies by telling of some
pressing need she had for money, or whether
she would be flippant and self-assured, still insisting
that she was the real Linda Carlton.</p>
<p>Mr. Von Goss&rsquo;s car appeared shortly after
Linda and Dot arrived, and they recognized
Mr. Leslie Sprague in the back seat. Both men
nodded to the girls, who had dismissed their
taxi and were standing beside one of the
hangars, talking to an attendant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See your names in the paper, girls?&rdquo; he
was asking them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. When?&rdquo; inquired Dot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>The mechanic picked up a newspaper and
handed it to them. There was a picture, somewhat
poor, to be sure, of Linda and Dot in their
flying suits and an account of their arrival, recalling
the incident of their strange landing
at Kansas City. Underneath were the names,
&ldquo;Miss Sallie Slocum and Miss May Manton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did they ever get that picture?&rdquo; demanded
Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snapped it when you weren&rsquo;t looking.
Those newspaper reporters are up to all sorts
of tricks. The beacon light is bright, and he had
a special camera.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda looked serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may make trouble for us, Dot,&rdquo; she
said, in a low voice.</p>
<p>The director and his secretary got out of the
car and advanced towards the girls just as an
airplane loomed into view. Linda stared excitedly
at the sky, trying to make out what kind
of plane it was. It was not an autogiro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she is!&rdquo; shouted Mr. Von Goss, and
Mr. Sprague took off his hat and waved it violently
into the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The secretary&rsquo;s pretty keen about the false
Linda, or I miss my guess,&rdquo; whispered Dot, in
her companion&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Look how excited he is!
How wildly he&rsquo;s waving!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>The aviatrix, who was just overhead, suddenly
banked her plane, and made a turn to the
left. Then she nosed her plane higher into the
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doing some stunts for us!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr.
Von Goss. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a great little flier, all
right&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s&mdash;she&rsquo;s going away!&rdquo; faltered Linda,
in deepest disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably forgotten something,&rdquo; remarked
Leslie Sprague, casually. &ldquo;I was almost certain,
anyhow, that she said three o&rsquo;clock&mdash;not
two. She&rsquo;ll most likely be back at three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean to say we&rsquo;ll have to wait a whole
hour?&rdquo; demanded Dot, as the plane disappeared
in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s up to you,&rdquo; returned Sprague, nonchalantly.</p>
<p>Mr. Von Goss reached into his pocket and
extracted a clipping. It was the newspaper picture
of Dot and Linda, with the fictitious names
under it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sprague showed me this,&rdquo; he said, handing
the clipping to Linda, with a suspicious look in
his eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Linda trembled in spite of herself, but Dot
immediately explained how it had happened.
Mr. Von Goss, however, looked doubtful of the
truth of the story, and Sprague listened with
a nasty grin on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to talk this over later,&rdquo; the director
said finally. &ldquo;I have an appointment
now. As soon as the girl arrives, you better all
come straight to the studio, where we can compare
licenses, and so on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is mine?&rdquo; demanded Linda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sprague&rsquo;s keeping it. He&rsquo;ll hand it over
when the time comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a brief nod of good-bye, the two men
drove away together, and the girls stood watching
them in dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something tells me that that young lady
won&rsquo;t be back here,&rdquo; Dot said dismally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not. Maybe she even saw us, for
her plane was pretty low. And if she had
glasses&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course she had glasses! No girl who
plays a tricky game like this one is going to go
about unprepared. It would be like a gangster
without a gun.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>They waited impatiently for over an hour,
but nothing happened, and even the men did
not return. Other planes flew into the busy
airport, landed and took off, but there was no
sign of Linda&rsquo;s &ldquo;double.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bored with the inactivity, they strolled over
to the hangar where the Ladybug was housed,
and looked her over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d fly over to the studio if I only had my
licenses,&rdquo; said Linda. &ldquo;But I hate to break
laws&mdash;even though it isn&rsquo;t my fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man has no right to keep them!&rdquo;
stormed Dot. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet Sprague&rsquo;s at the bottom
of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s still trying to protect his girl-friend,
I&rsquo;m sure of that.... Well, Dot, we may as
well go back to the hotel, for if she should arrive,
I feel confident that Mr. Von Goss would
call us there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda&rsquo;s confidence, however, was sadly misplaced.
For no one at the studio called to inform
her that the other girl landed her plane
right on the set a little after three o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>With the neatness of a born flier, she brought
her plane to the ground, climbed out of the
cockpit and strolled into Mr. Von Goss&rsquo;s office.
The director had not yet returned, but Sprague
was sitting at his desk. In a few words he explained
the situation, but before the girl could
make any reply, Mr. Von Goss walked in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard the story, Miss&mdash;Carlton?&rdquo;
he asked, hesitating a little over the name.</p>
<p>The girl, who really resembled Linda to a
remarkable degree, laughed and shrugged her
shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m used to things like that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It
used to worry me at first, but I never pay any
attention to them now. Why, Mr. Von Goss,
you can see for yourself how absurd the claim
is! The girl&rsquo;s real name&mdash;Sallie Slocum&mdash;has
been printed in the newspaper twice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course that&rsquo;s true. But how about
those license cards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your detective will soon prove them counterfeits.
And the signatures forged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still, the man hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other girl said something about taking
a test. Said she was the only licensed mechanic
in the country. That made it sound pretty genuine
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the girl laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;That was a clever ruse,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But
probably Miss Slocum has passed that test
since I did, and thinks she knows more than I
would.... No, Mr. Von Goss, I haven&rsquo;t time
to fool around here taking tests. I&rsquo;ve got to be
on my way tomorrow. So if you want me in the
picture, you&rsquo;ll have to let me go through my
stunts now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how it can be done&mdash;&rdquo; began the
director.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; agreed the girl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better
give you back your check, because I&rsquo;m really
too busy to wait around here. After all, the
money doesn&rsquo;t mean much to me&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t
need the publicity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Von Goss looked at her keenly. She must
be the real Linda, he thought, or she certainly
wouldn&rsquo;t talk like this. It never occurred to him
that she was acting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to give up now. We&rsquo;ll go
through with your part of the show....
Sprague, get the people on the wire....&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, while Linda and Dot were patiently
waiting for their telephone call at the hotel, the
impostor almost completed her part in the picture,
promising to return for only a couple of
hours&rsquo; work in the morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">THE FORGED SIGNATURE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Miss Slocum,&rdquo; said Mr.
Sprague, smugly, as Linda and Dot entered the
studio at Culver City the following day.</p>
<p>Linda winced at the name, and looked around
her, to see whether another girl could be entering
at the same time. But there was no one
except a strange young man sitting in the corner,
who couldn&rsquo;t possibly be &ldquo;Miss Slocum.&rdquo;
The secretary was evidently giving her a dig;
perhaps he was trying to trap her by calling
her by the name which Dot had manufactured
on the spur of the moment at Kansas City, and
which had been repeated by the newspapers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trying to be funny, Mr. Sprague?&rdquo; inquired
Dot, scathingly.</p>
<p>The stranger in the corner arose from his
seat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is Mr. Bertram Chase, of the police,&rdquo;
Sprague announced, calmly. &ldquo;Miss Slocum and
Miss Manton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls regarded the young man questioningly.
He was in plain clothes&mdash;not an ordinary
policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A detective,&rdquo; explained Sprague, simply.</p>
<p>Dot became impatient; she wanted to get to
the point of their visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should like to meet the aviatrix who
calls herself Linda Carlton,&rdquo; she announced,
in a business-like tone. &ldquo;Has she come in yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is on the set now,&rdquo; replied Sprague.
&ldquo;Going through her stunts. She has only a
small part in the picture, so it can all be done at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you kindly take us out where she is?&rdquo;
asked Linda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a minute, sister,&rdquo; returned the man, condescendingly.
&ldquo;But we have some business
with you first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda&rsquo;s expression became freezing. She
could not bear this insolent young man. He
smiled in an irritating manner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have examined your licenses, Miss
Slocum,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And we believe the signatures
have been forged. The real Miss Carlton
brought hers today, and we compared the two.
There is no doubt that hers is genuine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; demanded Linda, in horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us see them!&rdquo; demanded Dot, entirely
unconvinced.</p>
<p>Mr. Sprague nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our friend, Mr. Chase, has them now. He
will let you look at them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man, who could not have been a
day over twenty-five, looked extremely embarrassed.
Not like a hard-boiled detective at all,
Linda thought. Indeed, he flashed her a look of
sympathy, as if he did not share in Sprague&rsquo;s
accusation. Still, it was his business, and he
had to go through with it.</p>
<p>He fumbled in his pockets and produced two
cards, identical at a glance. The same numbers,
the same printing&mdash;and what looked like the
same signatures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let them out of your hands, Chase,&rdquo;
warned Sprague, evidently determined to be as
nasty as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, ladies,&rdquo; Chase said, almost apologetically.
&ldquo;This signature is forged.&rdquo; He held
up one of the cards. &ldquo;Look at the capital &lsquo;L&rsquo;.
It hasn&rsquo;t been copied quite right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it hasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Dot. &ldquo;But the
other one is yours, Linda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Linda, trembling in spite of
her innocence, &ldquo;I remember that mud-spot on
mine. I got it on that treasure-hunt that Mr.
Clavering planned, from Green Falls last summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Odd,&rdquo; remarked Sprague, sarcastically.
&ldquo;That is the very mud-spot the real Miss Carlton
identified her card by!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you propose to do?&rdquo; demanded
Dot, now thoroughly exasperated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold Miss Slocum under bail,&rdquo; replied
Sprague. &ldquo;For forgery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dot burst into a peal of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too absurd!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>The young detective looked exceedingly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we go out on the lot?&rdquo; he suggested.
&ldquo;And see the stunts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O. K. by me,&rdquo; agreed Sprague.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we to wear hand-cuffs?&rdquo; inquired Dot,
flippantly.</p>
<p>Sprague gave her a withering look.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are not being held at all, Miss Manton,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not concerned under
what names you care to travel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young detective fell back and walked
across the lots with the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you are innocent, Miss&mdash;Carlton,&rdquo;
he said, his brown eyes already showing devotion
to Linda. &ldquo;Of course I have to take your
money for bail, but I&rsquo;m sure it will be all
cleared up soon. I think that the other girl is
the impostor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, Mr. Chase!&rdquo; cried Linda,
the tears dangerously near to her eyes at this
expression of sympathy.</p>
<p>The group reached the lot, where the picture
was being rehearsed. It looked so interesting,
so thrilling,&mdash;had it been under any other circumstances,
the girls would have only been too
delighted at the opportunity. But now they
could think only of the horrible fix they were in,
with not a friend in this strange city to vindicate
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Mr. Von Goss, who was buzzing busily about
the lot, paid no attention at all to Dot and Linda&mdash;not
even a formal nod of greeting as he
passed them by. He had evidently decided that
they were impostors, who had cleverly deceived
him, thereby securing for themselves an evening&rsquo;s
unusual entertainment at his expense.
Therefore, he preferred not to recognize them
at all. The deliberate cut hurt Linda, for she
had liked and admired the older man, and had
found him exceedingly interesting.</p>
<p>The moving-picture aviatrix, however, was
going through all sorts of stunts in a silver
Moth, which had been brightly painted and decorated.
Linda stood still, gazing at her enviously.
Not that she wanted to be in the picture,
but she would always rather be in the air than
on the ground. And it looked now as if she
were to be chained to the earth for several days
to come, unless she or Dot could think of a way
out of their difficulties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl&rsquo;s too low!&rdquo; cried Chase suddenly,
in horror.</p>
<p>Linda watched her; she certainly was dangerously
near to the ground. The roar of her
motor was deafening. But, by a stroke of luck,
she regained control, and abruptly pointed her
plane upward, climbing without disaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; admitted Linda, in all fairness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not so good as she looks,&rdquo; remarked Chase.
&ldquo;I happen to know that plane and it will take
a lot of punishment. But she&rsquo;ll do that little
stunt once too often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a flier too, Mr. Chase?&rdquo; inquired
Linda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a secret-service
man, on the air force of the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked right into Linda&rsquo;s eyes, as if to
tell her that his love of flying was another bond
of sympathy between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you happen to be called in&mdash;on an
unimportant case like ours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here on something else. Connected with
another case. And I know Mr. Von Goss personally,
so he asked me to help him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.... I suppose I shouldn&rsquo;t ask you
for advice, Mr. Chase&mdash;but&mdash;I feel as if you
would help me, if possible. What would you do
if you were in my place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wire to somebody well known in aviation
circles, who can come and identify you as <i>the
girl who flew the Atlantic alone</i>. Because that
is the important thing. That&rsquo;s why Von Goss
is paying the aviatrix thirty thousand dollars
for a small part in one picture. Just because
of that one fact!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then friends wouldn&rsquo;t help&mdash;in establishing
my identity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. They ought to be people in aviation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dot interrupted this conversation, by suddenly
grasping Linda&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Look at
Sprague!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Look at the way he&rsquo;s
waving that hat of his to his girl-friend! Now
what do you suppose the idea of that is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the mention of his own name, the secretary
turned to the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Carlton is supposed to fly away&mdash;be
lost to sight now,&rdquo; he informed them, calmly.
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t likely she&rsquo;ll come back and land here,
for that finishes her part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean we&rsquo;re not to see her?&rdquo; demanded
Dot. &ldquo;That looks suspicious to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah?&rdquo; returned Sprague. &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t
flatter yourselves that Miss Linda Carlton has
time to waste on a couple of upstarts from
Toonerville, or wherever it was you came from.
She&rsquo;s a busy girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda sighed deeply as she watched the plane
disappear entirely from view. There was
nothing to do now; Sprague and Von Goss were
both against her. She might as well go back
to the hotel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come to the hotel this afternoon for that
check for bail,&rdquo; she said to Chase. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have
it ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, with a nod of farewell, she and Dot
left the lot and went into a restaurant at Culver
City for their lunch. But this time they were
not interested in seeing the stars. Their own
problems were too pressing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could only get in touch with Daddy,&rdquo;
said Linda, as she nibbled at her salad. &ldquo;But
I don&rsquo;t know where he is, and I should hate to
alarm Aunt Emily by telling her that I am being
held under bail. No ... I guess the best
idea is to wire Mr. Eckert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; approved Dot. &ldquo;Why
not go over to that telephone and do it now,
while I order something for dessert?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda took the suggestion, and fifteen minutes
later the girls started back for their hotel
in Los Angeles. They felt like prisoners, unable
to come and go at will. As a matter of
fact, Dot was still as free as air, but she had no
thought of deserting Linda.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>They bought the afternoon paper on their
way back to the hotel, and when they reached
their room, Dot spread it out on her bed to read.
But the first item that met her eye made her
stare in horror. It was Linda&rsquo;s picture, right
on the front page, with the caption
&ldquo;Miss Sallie Slocum, impersonating Linda
Carlton,&rdquo; and underneath it, the whole dishonest
story.</p>
<p>She read it in rising anger, determined to
destroy it before Linda should see it. But her
companion, noticing the look on her chum&rsquo;s
face, crossed the room and saw it for herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a soul will believe it is really I!&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;Because it doesn&rsquo;t look a whole
lot like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it certainly doesn&rsquo;t. It must be that
same picture the reporter took of us both at the
airport, the day we landed here in Los Angeles.
Only I&rsquo;m cut off. I&rsquo;m not news any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re free, Dot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet it&rsquo;s all my fault!&rdquo; She wound her arms
around Linda. &ldquo;Darling, I just can&rsquo;t tell you
how sorry I am for that silly prank!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda patted her hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think of it as your fault, Dot. That
name business is only a side-issue. That girl
would have gotten away with it, no matter what
we did. She&rsquo;d have thought up something else
if she hadn&rsquo;t had that to play on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I played right into her hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. Only, any girl who would go to all
this trouble to invent such a dishonest scheme
would have succeeded somehow. Why, the
licenses were really the most important thing.
But how she ever managed to get them exchanged
without that smart Sprague noticing,
is more than I can account for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you must remember he wasn&rsquo;t prejudiced
against her as he was against you. He
trusted her, so he probably wasn&rsquo;t watching her
closely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I detest that man,&rdquo; said Linda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; agreed Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this isn&rsquo;t getting us anywhere,&rdquo; remarked
Linda, with a yawn. &ldquo;I think a nap
would do us good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, wisely acting upon the suggestion, the
girls slept until Mr. Chase called at five o&rsquo;clock
for Linda&rsquo;s check for one thousand dollars for
bail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which I hate to have to take,&rdquo; he said,
apologetically. &ldquo;But I expect to give it back
to you soon!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">STOLEN!</span></h2>
<p>Linda and Dot both felt terribly depressed,
in spite of their luxurious surroundings. Indeed,
both girls had showed more spirit on that
deserted island in the Atlantic Ocean, where
they had been stranded without any plane during
the early summer. When both their food
and their water supply were limited, and the
chances of survival were small. But now there
was nothing to do but wait&mdash;wait in this
strange, lonely city, where their only friends&mdash;Mr.
Von Goss and Mr. Chase&mdash;had turned out
to be enemies. And now Mr. Chase was going
away, flying south on important business, so
that even he would be lost to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will soon be free,&rdquo; he had said,
after he had heard that Linda had wired for
Mr. Eckert.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;In time to stop that picture&rsquo;s being shown,
do you think?&rdquo; inquired Linda. &ldquo;I understand
that the rest of it was completed, and that all
that had to be filmed was my double&rsquo;s part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I believe that&rsquo;s what Von Goss said.
But surely it won&rsquo;t be released for a month or
so. I shouldn&rsquo;t worry. You do hate publicity,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he asked, sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have always tried to shun it,&rdquo; answered
Linda. &ldquo;But it seems that I am being punished
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the young man had gone, and the girls
were feeling very blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to pull ourselves together!&rdquo; announced
Dot, after a few minutes of somber
silence. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s step out and go to a show tonight!
After all, you paid that thousand dollars
bail, and we might as well get some fun
out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; admitted Linda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a picture this time. A theatre. I&rsquo;m sick
of movies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And let&rsquo;s make a rule, with a forfeit of five
dollars, if either of us mentions that aviatrix,
or Sprague, or any other vermin we have met
around the studio, we have to pay the other!
Is it a go?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;Does that include Mr. Chase?&rdquo; asked Linda,
slyly.</p>
<p>Dot poked her companion under the chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t
exactly describe him as &lsquo;vermin&rsquo;.... And besides,
I can see that you were rather smitten.
And did he fall for you? Whew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a nice young man, don&rsquo;t you think so,
Dot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do. But poor Ralph! How
jealous he&rsquo;d be, if he only knew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ralph will be furious because I didn&rsquo;t wire
to him to help us out. But after all, he&rsquo;s only a
personal friend, and of course his assertions
about my innocence wouldn&rsquo;t carry much
weight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re agreed, then,&rdquo; said Dot, as she began
to dress for dinner, &ldquo;that the tabu subjects are
Von Goss, movies, Sprague, and your double.
At five dollars apiece!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Linda laughed, but she felt much better.
Trust Dot to find some fun in every situation,
no matter how unpleasant or dangerous it
seemed. They were able to get seats at a very
good play, and in the excitement of the mystery
involved, they forgot all about their own
troubles, and had no need to worry about the
forfeit.</p>
<p>It was lucky indeed that they were able to
enjoy their evening, for the next morning held
a most unpleasant surprise for them. They had
gone for a walk after breakfast and returned to
the hotel about eleven o&rsquo;clock, hoping for some
word from Mr. Eckert.</p>
<p>The telephone rang and Linda picked it up
gaily, expecting it to be the message. But it
proved to be a message of a very different sort
a summons from a police-court in Los Angeles!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The officer wants you to come downstairs
immediately, Miss Carlton,&rdquo; the operator told
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going too,&rdquo; announced Dot, following
her companion into the elevator.</p>
<p>A uniformed policeman was waiting for
Linda in the lobby. He was a rough, uneducated
person of the lower class, evidently accustomed
to bullying his suspects into submission.
He did not return Linda&rsquo;s feeble &ldquo;Good
morning,&rdquo; but merely extended a piece of paper
with his right hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your bum check!&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;For bail.
You had no right to sign the name of &lsquo;Linda
Carlton&rsquo; anyhow, but besides that, there ain&rsquo;t
no funds to cover it&mdash;even if you say you are
the real &lsquo;Linda&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No funds!&rdquo; gasped Linda, staring incredulously
at the man. &ldquo;Why, I keep five thousand
dollars in my check account&mdash;just to be ready
for any kind of emergencies that may come up
when I&rsquo;m flying about the country!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the amount that was took out
yesterday. By the real Linda Carlton.&rdquo; His
tone was jeering, as if he were enjoying the
situation as he would a play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Linda. &ldquo;This is terrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it is,&rdquo; agreed the policeman. &ldquo;Now
get your hat, and come along with me. You&rsquo;re
goin&rsquo; to jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls looked at each other in speechless
amazement. This was too dreadful for words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me wire for the money,&rdquo; suggested Dot,
suddenly. &ldquo;I can get it from my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do as you like. But this here forger goes
to jail&mdash;even if she is a pretty girl. That ain&rsquo;t
a gonna help her none now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>The tears came to Linda&rsquo;s eyes, in spite of
her effort to hold them back. She felt dizzy and
weak. It was all like a hideous nightmare, from
which, try as she might, she could not awaken.
She opened her mouth to speak, but only a
stifled sob came. Then, with a hopeless gesture
of powerlessness, she decided to do as she was
told.</p>
<p>She turned about desperately and walked
towards the elevator like a criminal going to
the electric chair. Dot, still trying to think of
some way to save the situation, waited, hesitating,
breathing hard. It was a tense and horrible
moment&mdash;until Linda walked right into the
arms of her dear old friend, Mr. Eckert!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Linda, I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo; he said, putting out his
arms to catch her, for he could see that she was
blinded by tears. &ldquo;Dear child, you&rsquo;re not going
to faint?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda looked up in a daze, too astonished to
believe that he was true. Had her imagination
conjured up his kindly presence? But no; Mr.
Eckert&rsquo;s hands were on her shoulders, supporting
her, keeping her from falling. And beside
him was a large, fine-looking man in a blue
uniform.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she gasped, in joy and relief, clinging
desperately to the elderly man&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing to Miss Carlton?&rdquo; demanded
the stranger in uniform, of the policeman.
&ldquo;Hounding her with abuse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This here young lady forged a name and
passed a bum check,&rdquo; he whimpered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What name?&rdquo; asked the other man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Claims she&rsquo;s Linda Carlton, with five thousand
bucks in a bank, where she&rsquo;s already overdrew
her account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is Linda Carlton!&rdquo; announced Mr.
Eckert. &ldquo;I can testify to that&mdash;your superior
officer, James A. Brenan, can testify to my
knowledge, for he knows me well. He is Chief
of Police in St. Louis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get here so soon, Mr. Eckert?&rdquo;
asked Dot. &ldquo;We only wired yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We started immediately, sensing your
trouble. And flew day and night. But I see that
we got here just in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten minutes later I&rsquo;d have been wearing
prison stripes!&rdquo; returned Linda, now almost
herself again. &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Eckert, I can never
thank you enough.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was only too thankful to be of use, my
dear child,&rdquo; said the kind-hearted man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do first?&rdquo; inquired Dot, as
the policeman made a move to slip away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch the thief,&rdquo; announced Chief Brenan.
&ldquo;If she has forged a check for five thousand
dollars already, she must have gone away as
fast as she could.&rdquo; He turned to the Los Angeles
policeman. &ldquo;Go and inform your station
of this as fast as you can.... And meanwhile,
we&rsquo;ll go straight to the studio of the Apex Film
Corporation and find out what we can about her
from the director.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The policeman departed, and Linda asked Mr.
Eckert whether he weren&rsquo;t terribly hungry and
tired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hungry, yes, but I haven&rsquo;t had time to
think about being tired yet. I want to get things
all straightened out for you first, before I consider
sleeping. We will arrange for a couple
of rooms and order a meal before we go to
Hollywood.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>In an incredibly short time the men reappeared
from their rooms and ate a hasty meal
that was both breakfast and lunch. Then the
whole party, the two girls, and the two older
men chartered a car for Culver City.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it be fun to stick out our tongues at
that Sprague insect?&rdquo; laughed Dot, now enjoying
herself hugely. &ldquo;He was so condescending&mdash;so
sure that the other girl was the real
thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m going to insist that they don&rsquo;t
show the picture under my name!&rdquo; added
Linda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll serve Mr. Von Goss right. I&rsquo;m glad
he&rsquo;s losing money. Remember how snippy he
was to us yesterday, on the lot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly was. Wouldn&rsquo;t even speak to
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may get his money back when we catch
the impostor,&rdquo; remarked Chief Brenan. &ldquo;She
can&rsquo;t have had a chance to spend much of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager she bought that plane that she
was doing stunts with,&rdquo; observed Linda. &ldquo;It
certainly was speedy. And she&rsquo;d want to get
out of the country as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>The short distance to Culver City was covered
quickly in the high-powered car. Dot was
the first to run into the studio when they arrived.
She wanted to have the fun of saying, &ldquo;I
told you so,&rdquo; to that &ldquo;fresh Sprig,&rdquo; as she
liked to call him.</p>
<p>The same &ldquo;publicity girl&rdquo; took their cards.
But, though Mr. Von Goss was in, she informed
them that Mr. Sprague was no longer with the
Apex.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fired?&rdquo; asked Dot, hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I believe not. He left yesterday&mdash;to be
married to Miss Linda Carlton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; contradicted Dot. &ldquo;This is
Miss Linda Carlton right here, and she&rsquo;d rather
be dead than married to that shrimp. Your
actress wasn&rsquo;t Linda Carlton at all&mdash;as we&rsquo;re
just about to prove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; remarked the girl, only slightly
interested. It was a practice of hers never to
frown or show emotion, lest she encourage
wrinkles.</p>
<p>They passed on in to the director&rsquo;s office, and
Linda introduced the two men and told her
story. When she had finished, Mr. Von Goss
looked extremely worried, crestfallen, even defeated.
For now Linda&rsquo;s identity was established
beyond a doubt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;How then do you account for this license?&rdquo;
he asked, extending the one with the forged signature
to Linda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sprague&rsquo;s doing, of course!&rdquo; cried Dot, before
Linda had a chance to answer. &ldquo;He was
in league with that girl. We just heard that
they were married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how could he manage these licenses?&rdquo;
demanded Von Goss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He got hold of a blank somehow, and forged
the name. Then when he had the chance to get
hold of the real Miss Carlton&rsquo;s, of course he exchanged
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief of Police was listening to Dot&rsquo;s
logic with admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bright girl,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve
figured it out just about right.&rdquo; He turned to
Linda. &ldquo;You should never have let your own
licenses get out of your hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no idea Mr. Sprague was dishonest,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;But the worst part of it is, that now
I have to fly with a false license.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get yours back when we catch that
couple!&rdquo; promised Von Goss. &ldquo;Because we&rsquo;ve
got to catch them. Why, I paid her thirty thousand
dollars for her part in the picture&mdash;and if
my picture is not shown, I&rsquo;ll lose thousands
more....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked terribly discouraged.</p>
<p>The Chief of Police rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must go back now and get to work.
Have you any idea, Von Goss, where this couple
went, or what kind of plane they flew in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard Sprague say something about South
America for a honeymoon,&rdquo; the man replied.
&ldquo;He told us to keep his mail for him, till he
came back, as he wouldn&rsquo;t have any definite address.
But I haven&rsquo;t any idea whether they expected
to fly, or what kind of plane they used if
they did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl didn&rsquo;t buy your plane&mdash;or steal
it?&rdquo; asked Linda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s still out there. We needed it today
for some stills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of plane did she own when she
came to the studio?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t own any. She told me that she
had left her autogiro at Spring City, and had
flown west with a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you believed every word of it!&rdquo; was
Dot&rsquo;s taunt. &ldquo;And never even asked to see her
license, until we showed up and made it necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all true,&rdquo; agreed the director. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we only knew what kind of plane, it would
be so much easier to follow and catch her,&rdquo; remarked
Linda, sadly.</p>
<p>Mr. Von Goss rose from his desk, and followed
the group to the door, lingering beside
Linda, as if he were trying to get up courage
to say something to her. For such a self-possessed
man, he seemed unusually nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Carlton,&rdquo; he said, in a humble tone,
&ldquo;won&rsquo;t you please do that part of the picture
for me?&rdquo; It seemed strange that a man who
could tell stars what to do, should speak so
deferentially to Linda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Mr. Von Goss,&rdquo; she replied immediately.
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t possibly. I&rsquo;m all keyed up
for a chase. I want to catch this girl, if it&rsquo;s the
last thing I ever do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let me pay you, say fifty thousand dollars
for the use of your name, and let me show
the picture as it is. Nobody would ever guess
that it isn&rsquo;t you. For she does look astonishingly
like you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t I love to see that girl!&rdquo; said Dot.</p>
<p>Again Linda shook her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
my name in moving-pictures, Mr. Von Goss,&rdquo;
she said with quiet determination. &ldquo;Besides, I
shouldn&rsquo;t like people to think I flew in the dangerous,
spectacular way that girl did. It is
harmful to the whole cause of aviation. No;
you cannot use my name in connection with
your picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Von Goss knew that she meant what she said,
and there was no use of any further argument.
But he was in a terrible fix, and he didn&rsquo;t know
how to get out of it without losing a great deal
of money. Certainly he couldn&rsquo;t use the name
of the girl&mdash;whatever it was&mdash;for when she was
caught, the whole world would know that she
was a criminal.</p>
<p>A solution of his problem, however, suddenly
suggested itself to Linda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it, Mr. Von Goss!&rdquo; she cried, turning
about. &ldquo;Use Ann Harding! She&rsquo;s a flier, and
a popular actress besides. She can do the
stunts, and probably will prove more of a drawing
card to the public than I could hope to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ann Harding!&rdquo; repeated the man. &ldquo;But she
belongs to another studio.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;Borrow her! Pay her! You&rsquo;ll save your
picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re right, Miss Carlton,&rdquo; he
admitted, with a sigh of relief. &ldquo;That ought to
save the situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The four visitors left the studio and hurried
in their car back to the hotel. But no news of
the couple had been received by any of the Los
Angeles police. Linda therefore determined to
pack a box of supplies and to set out, that very
afternoon, on the search, inquiring at the airports
they passed as they flew towards Mexico.</p>
<p>Just before sitting down to her late lunch
with Dot, she wired the news to her aunt, informing
her of her plans, and asking that additional
funds be put into her checking account.
Then she called the airport on the telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Linda Carlton,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want
you to have my autogiro in readiness for a long
trip. Plenty of gas and oil. I will call for it inside
of an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Linda Carlton?&rdquo; repeated the voice at the
other end of the wire. &ldquo;Autogiro?... Must be
some mistake.... Miss Carlton flew away in
her autogiro last night, about eight o&rsquo;clock. She
paid the bill, and said she wouldn&rsquo;t be back!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">IN HOT PURSUIT</span></h2>
<p>Linda replaced the telephone receiver and
sat motionless, staring at the wall of the hotel
bedroom. The worst had happened. The autogiro
was stolen. The Ladybug! Her dearest
possession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Dot, realizing
that her chum must have heard bad news.</p>
<p>In a few words Linda explained the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the worst of it is, that girl evidently
didn&rsquo;t have any difficulty at all about doing it.
Just walked into the airport at night and demanded
the plane. They handed it over to her
without so much as a question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For once in her life, Dot remained speechless.
There was not a single word of comfort she
could think of to offer to her companion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s had almost a whole day&rsquo;s start,&rdquo;
Linda added dismally. &ldquo;Here it is three o&rsquo;clock,
and she must have pulled out at dark last night.
She&rsquo;s probably out of the United States by this
time. And nobody even on her trail yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our police always catch the wrong person,
anyway,&rdquo; remarked Dot, grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too hard on them, Dot. They&rsquo;re
not all like that dreadful specimen that came
for me this morning. And in a case like this,
they would probably put the air-force on duty.
Men of a much higher type.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like Mr. Chase, for instance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do, Linda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call the police headquarters first. Tell
them to get in touch with all the airports possible,
so that any autogiros can be reported.
But I&rsquo;d like to go after that girl myself, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In what?&rsquo; is right! Oh, if I only had a
plane! If Ted Mackay were only here&mdash;or even
Ralph, with his autogiro! But do you realize,
Dot, that I&rsquo;m bankrupt? I can&rsquo;t buy a plane,
or even hire one, now that that girl took everything
I had in the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her companion nodded. &ldquo;If somebody would
only lend you one,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Maybe Mr.
Eckert&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of him. But he has to get back
to the school immediately. Why, Dot, this is
the twenty-ninth of September! We&rsquo;ve wasted
a whole week, just to establish the fact that I
am Linda Carlton! Isn&rsquo;t it just too absurd!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the craziest thing I ever heard of. And
now you&rsquo;ll lose your chance at that teaching
position, unless you give up trying to get your
Ladybug back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that. I couldn&rsquo;t give up now. No,
I&rsquo;ll call the police headquarters, and then I&rsquo;ll
wait around until Mr. Eckert wakes up from
his nap. We&rsquo;ll surprise the men by having dinner
with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was indeed a surprise, as Linda expected,
when she and Dot met Mr. Eckert and Chief
Brenan in the lobby of the hotel that evening
at seven o&rsquo;clock. Naturally, both men thought
that the girls had flown away early in the afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tied to the earth again,&rdquo; Linda announced
immediately. &ldquo;But not by the law this
time.... That girl flew off in my autogiro!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Mr. Eckert, incredulously.
&ldquo;Why, there isn&rsquo;t anything she won&rsquo;t steal!&rdquo;
He smiled grimly. &ldquo;Did she leave you your
own clothing, Linda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s about
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have had me wakened the minute
you heard the news. If you had done that,
you might have been on your way by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;?&rdquo; gasped Linda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my plane, of course. Take it and welcome,
my dear child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda seized his hand and tried to stammer
out her thanks. But she was too much moved by
his generosity to say anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will you get back to St. Louis in time
for the opening of your school?&rdquo; inquired Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the commercial air-line,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Eckert. &ldquo;Now come in and eat some dinner,
and after that, you can make your plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to Linda almost too good to be
true. To have the privilege of flying that new,
fast biplane, which she had admired so much
that morning. It had a cruising speed of a
hundred and fifty miles an hour! Surely, in it,
she could catch her own Ladybug.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll start early tomorrow morning, I suppose?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Eckert, as they seated themselves
in the dining-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Linda. &ldquo;The police are
already on the job, in communication with all
the airports, which are to keep a watch out for
all autogiros that pass overhead or land for
gas. We&rsquo;ll find out what reports have been
turned in, before we take off in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will you go along, Miss Crowley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Dot. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just as anxious
to recover the Ladybug as Linda is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may mean dangerous business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bound to be exciting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After dinner Chief Brenan telephoned to the
police headquarters to find out what information
had been gained. Three autogiros, he
learned, had been spotted, but only two of them
had been stopped. Neither of these was the
Ladybug. The third, it seemed, had been seen
early in the day, flying southeast across California
toward Arizona. Two secret-service
planes had already been sent out in that direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>With Mr. Eckert&rsquo;s help, Linda sketched out
a course to follow. She would head straight
for the city of Yuma, in the extreme southwest
of Arizona, stopping there for the first
night. Then she would go over the border into
Mexico.</p>
<p>Dot, in the meanwhile, took charge of the
practical preparations for the trip. She arranged
to leave their box of clothing at the
hotel, and packed all the supplies for the trip.
Water in gallon jugs and thermos bottles,
canned food, blankets in case they were forced
to camp out at night, field glasses and first-aid
kit&mdash;and finally, upon Mr. Eckert&rsquo;s suggestion&mdash;a
revolver.</p>
<p>The whole party breakfasted at dawn the following
morning, and Mr. Eckert accompanied
the girls to the airport, to sign the necessary
papers for the release of his plane, the Sky
Rocket. It was a beautiful new biplane, of the
latest model. Painted yellow, with a companion
cockpit, it stood in readiness on the runway, as
if inviting Linda to climb in and fly.</p>
<p>Her eyes were shining in happy anticipation
as she skipped forward and climbed into the
cockpit to peer at the instruments. Everything
for convenience and comfort seemed to be provided.
Altimeter, clocks, compass, parachutes&mdash;even
a wireless, with transmitting radio wires
placed inside the wings, so that messages could
be sent and received.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s marvellous, Mr. Eckert!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
as she seated herself at the controls,
her hand fingering the joy-stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you even going to give her a trial
flight, Miss Carlton?&rdquo; inquired the mechanic,
skeptically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Carlton can pilot any plane that&rsquo;s
made!&rdquo; replied Mr. Eckert, proudly. &ldquo;She
never needs any instruction. But,&rdquo; he added,
coming closer to Linda, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t forget that this
isn&rsquo;t an autogiro. Don&rsquo;t try to land her on top
of a building!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only wish I had my own license,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t worry about that,&rdquo; returned
Mr. Eckert. &ldquo;The police aren&rsquo;t going to make
any more mistakes about arresting you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should hope not!&rdquo; exclaimed Dot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>A minute later the mechanic started the
motor, and Linda taxied along the runway, waving
good-bye to Mr. Eckert. A few hundred
feet further, and the Sky Rocket rose into the
air like a bird, soaring up to the skies. The
usual fog common to the early morning climate
of California had lifted, and the sun shone
brightly as Linda directed her course towards
the mountains. She let out the throttle to its
maximum as soon as she reached a good safe
height; a hundred and fifty miles an hour did
not seem an abnormal speed, but it was a thrilling
experience. Linda loved her own Ladybug,
but after all, this was an exciting change.</p>
<p>Over the orange groves of southern California
they passed again, then, even higher up
in the air to clear the San Jacinto Mountains,
over the city of Imperial&mdash;on towards Yuma.
The flight was nearly four hundred miles, but
Linda covered it in less than four hours. At
noon she landed the Sky Rocket at the airport
of Yuma, Arizona.</p>
<p>Being a large airport, the men had already
been informed by radio of the stolen autogiro,
and the attendant who came out to greet the
Sky Rocket was prepared to answer Linda&rsquo;s
questions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;A giro stopped here yesterday for gas and
oil,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And we filled her up. Put a
patch on one wing, but the couple wouldn&rsquo;t wait
long enough to have it done right. That must
have been about three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon.
We got the radio soon after that, to take the
licenses of all the giros we got a look at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did the people look like? Were they a
man and a girl?&rdquo; demanded Dot, excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. A married couple, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On their honeymoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell you that. They didn&rsquo;t act mushy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they give you their names?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did the girl look like&mdash;Miss Carlton?&rdquo;
put in Dot, before the man could answer
Linda&rsquo;s question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t say she did, except that all you
girl fliers look something alike. But her face
was pretty dirty, and her helmet was pulled
down low.... Yeah, they gave their names.
A Mr. and Mrs. Bower, of Texas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Linda, in disappointment.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking for people named Sprague.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t be likely to give their right
names, Linda,&rdquo; Dot reminded her. &ldquo;Why, that
girl thinks nothing of swiping a new name to
fit her fancy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; admitted Linda.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;And another thing,&rdquo; added the attendant.
&ldquo;There was a secret-service flier here this
morning already. After them. A nice-looking
chap, in a gray monoplane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could it have been Mr. Chase?&rdquo; demanded
Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. I think that was the name.... Well,
he crossed the border, hot on their trail.
Shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he had &rsquo;em by now,
for he flew a fast plane!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The news was encouraging, so after a bite
of lunch and a hasty inspection, the girls flew
away again, heading south now, avoiding the
Gulf of California, and crossing over into
Mexico.</p>
<p>They passed over the California river and
continued an easterly course, avoiding the
mountains near the coast, and pointing inland
before they turned southeast again. From their
height in the air they could not see the ground
without glasses, but as Linda dipped lower,
they could distinguish how barren and desolate
it was. There were no trees; only short,
stumpy underbrush scattered about, with big
patches of bare, hard earth between. A most
unattractive part of the country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>The engine of the plane continued to throb
evenly; it was in perfect condition. At least,
Linda thought, her plane was giving her no
worry. But then, planes were more like automobiles
now; the accidents were oftener due to
the pilots themselves than to faulty motors....
But thus far, she had accomplished nothing.
There had been no sign of an autogiro, or indeed
of any kind of plane, since they left
Arizona.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may be flying too high,&rdquo; she remarked,
as the hours passed without any success. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid to dip too low with this plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that must be the trouble,&rdquo; responded
her companion. &ldquo;They could come down
amongst those bushes and camp for the night,
and we&rsquo;d never see them. It seems like a wild-goose
chase to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to give up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not as long as we can get any news at
all. And they can&rsquo;t go on forever without gas.
They&rsquo;ll have to stop at airports every once in
a while to refuel, and then they&rsquo;ll be caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of these little Mexican places may not
have been informed,&rdquo; observed Linda. &ldquo;If they
didn&rsquo;t speak English&mdash;or didn&rsquo;t have a radio.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>On and on they flew, over this hot, deserted
land, so uncultivated and barren. The sun sank
and twilight came on&mdash;and still no sign of a
town or an airport where the girls might land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m lost,&rdquo; Linda admitted to
Dot, when it became too dim to distinguish the
ground even with the aid of glasses. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have
to fly lower, and look for a landing. I think
remember a place a couple of miles back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She circled about and began flying in the opposite
direction, cautiously gliding a little
nearer to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mind sleeping out tonight, Dot?&rdquo;
she inquired.</p>
<p>Her companion made a face. She had read
enough about Mexican bandits not to relish the
prospect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;ll have to,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Anyway,
we have plenty of food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darkness was coming on fast; there was nothing
to do but take a chance at landing. Beyond
them stretched great black mountains,
deep and forbidding, inhabited, they felt sure,
by all sorts of wild animals. These must be
avoided at any cost; so Linda went back to the
spot she had selected and prepared to make a
dangerous landing. How thankful she was that
she had had plenty of experience in spot landings!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>Keeping the plane still high enough to maintain
the glide to the spot, she combined
maneuvers to accomplish her purpose. From a
glide, she went into a side-slip until she lost
altitude, then, as she approached the landing-mark,
she gradually reduced speed with the
forward slip, straightening out just as she
reached the ground. And landed on the exact
spot she had selected!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good work, Linda!&rdquo; cried Dot, admiringly.</p>
<p>Linda grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid I might be out of practice,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Spoiled by my Ladybug. It&rsquo;s a satisfaction
to know I can still land an ordinary
plane. I guess she&rsquo;ll be all right, just here....
Now for some food! I&rsquo;m starved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I. And thirsty too.... Where shall
we make our camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked all about them. In spite of the
gathering darkness, they could see bare ground
everywhere; only a few clumps of dry bushes
in the distance. It was not exactly the spot one
would select to camp out, if given a choice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not too near the plane,&rdquo; said Linda.
&ldquo;Though I guess we don&rsquo;t need to build a fire.
I don&rsquo;t believe we could find any wood. No;
let&rsquo;s just open a can or two, and eat oranges
and biscuits for tonight. Anything would taste
good now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They prepared their meal and ate it almost in
silence, for they were too weary to talk. Then,
crawling into their blankets, although the night
was exceedingly mild, they went to sleep under
the stars.</p>
<p>The first faint rays of light were appearing
when Linda was abruptly awakened by a familiar
sound over her head. She sat up, reaching
instinctively for her revolver at her side, and
looking about her for some animal which might
be the cause of the noise. But the sound, now
more loud than before, was not that of an animal.
It grew nearer, almost deafening&mdash;over
her head. An airplane, of course! Now fully
awake, she looked up into the skies. The plane
was descending; a flashlight was turned into her
face. Blinded for an instant, she looked away.
Then, as she turned her gaze upon it again, she
saw it on the ground. And, wonder of wonders,
it was an autogiro!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>Excitedly she turned to her companion. But
Dot was still sleeping peacefully. That wasn&rsquo;t
surprising; it had always been hard to waken
Dot. Alarms right beside her bed never had any
effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dot!&rdquo; she whispered, disentangling herself
from her blanket, and edging up nearer to her
chum. &ldquo;Dot! Wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Linda stopped suddenly; she couldn&rsquo;t
say anything more. With the speed of a bolt of
lightning, a man ran at her, and, grasping both
Linda&rsquo;s hands with one of his, he clapped a
wet rag over her face with the other. She had
just time enough to identify her attacker as
Sprague, when she fell to the ground unconscious.
And, although she did not see what
happened next, the same fate was accorded to
Dot.</p>
<p>Both girls had been chloroformed!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">THE LADYBUG!</span></h2>
<p>Dot was the first of the two girls to come to
consciousness. With a gasp for breath, she
pushed the cloth from her face and sat up.
For a moment or two everything swam about
her; she didn&rsquo;t know where she was.</p>
<p>She thought at first that she and Linda were
on that deserted island in the Atlantic Ocean
where they had been stranded early in the summer.
But no; the ground was hard and dry&mdash;not
a bit sandy&mdash;and there was no ocean in
view. That couldn&rsquo;t be the explanation. For
there was the Ladybug within a few hundred
yards!</p>
<p>She glanced at Linda and saw that she was
lying motionless beside her on the barren
ground, her blanket thrown aside. With a cloth
over her face! In sudden panic Dot pulled it
off desperately. Oh, suppose Linda were dead!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;Linda! Darling!&rdquo; she implored piteously,
but there was no reply, no movement from the
inert figure. With a tremendous effort Dot
forced herself to rise and bend over her chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me you aren&rsquo;t dead, Linda!&rdquo; she
begged, hysterically.</p>
<p>A faint flutter of her companion&rsquo;s eyelids
came as a response.</p>
<p>With a tremendous effort, Dot reached for
the thermos bottle and held water to Linda&rsquo;s
lips. At last the color came faintly back to the
aviatrix&rsquo;s face, and she smiled faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;all right&mdash;Dot,&rdquo; she managed to whisper.
&ldquo;But what happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dot took a drink of the water herself, and
felt more revived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; asked Linda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somewhere in Mexico. Don&rsquo;t you remember?
We were flying after that girl, in Mr.
Eckert&rsquo;s Sky Rocket, and we came down for the
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda rubbed her eyes and looked about her.
And caught sight of the Ladybug, whose appearance
had so amazed Dot a moment before.
And rubbed her eyes, and stared again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;Am I crazy, Dot&mdash;or is that really an autogiro
over there? Or am I seeing things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Ladybug,&rdquo; replied Dot. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m positive.
We couldn&rsquo;t both be dreaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did it get here? Is that girl
around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hear her. Unless she&rsquo;s hiding.&rdquo;
Dot lowered her voice to a whisper. &ldquo;Have you
got your revolver handy, Linda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda felt at her side, where she had put it
the previous night when she went to sleep, and
sure enough, it was there. And, with the touch
of that revolver, memory of the scene that preceded
unconsciousness returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember now!&rdquo; she cried triumphantly.
&ldquo;I was wakened just as it was getting light, by
a big noise. I finally identified it as a plane.
At first I thought it was bandits, and I recall
reaching for my revolver.... Yes.... Then I
saw it was an autogiro. It landed ... and a
man ... it was Sprague, I&rsquo;m sure ... came and
clapped that rag over my face. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How ghastly!&rdquo; cried Dot. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t seem to
remember a thing myself. I must have been
sound asleep when he did it to me. But where
is he now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; exclaimed Linda, with a sudden
flash of understanding. &ldquo;They must have made
off in Mr. Eckert&rsquo;s plane! In the Sky Rocket&mdash;for
it&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; agreed Dot. &ldquo;But how
do you suppose they ever spotted us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, the Ladybug can fly much
lower than we could in the Sky Rocket,&rdquo; Linda
explained. &ldquo;They probably saw us in the air&mdash;when
we didn&rsquo;t see them&mdash;and followed us
about till they saw where we made our landing.
Then they waited for us to get to sleep, and for
early morning light to help them in landing and
taking off, and then descended on us with the
chloroform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think they wanted to swap
planes?&rdquo; asked Dot. &ldquo;Because the Sky Rocket
is faster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And it wouldn&rsquo;t be so easy to spot in
the sky as an autogiro. Besides, by doing this,
they know they will be throwing the police off
the clue. Pretty clever, I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those two are about the slickest pair of
schemers I&rsquo;ve ever heard of. There&rsquo;s nothing
they don&rsquo;t think of.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;And with each new trick they make a gain.
Mr. Eckert&rsquo;s plane is faster, newer, and more
expensive than the Ladybug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True. But aren&rsquo;t you glad to have the dear
old Ladybug back again?&rdquo; asked Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I surely am. If she will fly. That&rsquo;s another
thing, Dot. You know that man at the airport
said that she had a damaged wing. So naturally,
the Spragues would be glad to get hold of
a fresh plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder whether they had trouble taking
off,&rdquo; observed Dot. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not any too easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but the ground&rsquo;s very hard. I guess they
haven&rsquo;t had any rain here all summer.... Come
on, Dot, if you&rsquo;re able to walk, let&rsquo;s go over
and see the Ladybug. I&rsquo;m dying to get a look at
her again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; agreed her companion.</p>
<p>Walking a trifle shakily at first, and feeling
extremely weak and queer after their experience,
the girls went slowly to the spot where
the autogiro was resting. Like her owner, she,
too, looked in bad condition, as if she had been
mistreated, and had travelled a great distance.
And, as Linda expected, the patch on the wing
was split open again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder they swapped planes!&rdquo; exclaimed
Linda. &ldquo;I guess that girl was pretty
desperate. Well, thank goodness, I keep stuff
on hand for repairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thank goodness you know how to do
it!&rdquo; added Dot, with admiration. &ldquo;Any other
girl would be in a fine picnic in a fix like this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of picnics, don&rsquo;t you think we&rsquo;d
feel better if we ate something? I don&rsquo;t feel a
bit sick at my stomach&mdash;only terribly weak.
Breakfast might help. They didn&rsquo;t take our
food and water, did they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t take what we left out for breakfast,&rdquo;
replied the chum. &ldquo;But unfortunately
we left most of our stuff in the plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll have to eat sparingly. But if I
work fast, I ought to be able to get off by noon,
and we can surely fly till we find a place to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have we gas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I just looked. Enough to go a couple
of hundred miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arm in arm they went back to their little
encampment and ate the food which Dot had reserved
for breakfast and drank the coffee in
one of the thermos bottles. The remainder of
the water they decided to keep for their flight,
and they still had half a dozen oranges which
Dot had purposely left out of the Sky Rocket,
expecting to eat them during the morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>Linda wasted no time. As soon as she had
finished eating she set right to work on the
damaged wing. It was not hard for her, for
she knew every tiniest detail of the construction.
How thankful she was that it was her
own Ladybug that she had to repair, and not a
strange plane!</p>
<p>Much to her delight, she found her own license
cards on the seat of the cockpit. Evidently
the girl had no further use for them.</p>
<p>After the repairs had been made to the outside
of the plane, Linda tested the engine. It
was not running so smoothly as she liked to
hear it. A spark plug was missing. With a
sigh, she set to work again.</p>
<p>Dot, who had cleaned up all evidences of their
camp, watched her in dismal silence. The day
grew hotter and hotter, the sun poured down
mercilessly on Linda, bending patiently over
her work while the perspiration streamed from
her face. But it was fixed at last; everything
was to her satisfaction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have an orange,&rdquo; she suggested,
wiping her face with her handkerchief. &ldquo;Oh,
maybe I wouldn&rsquo;t like a good swim right now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we haven&rsquo;t even water enough to wash
our faces!&rdquo; lamented Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we only had that gallon jug we put into
the Sky Rocket!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, we will soon find a town, now that
it is light enough to find our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dot brought the oranges, and they tasted
good, although they had become exceedingly
warm from the hot sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think we&rsquo;ll have any trouble taking off?&rdquo;
she inquired, as they finished the fruit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess not. If the Sky Rocket could get
off&mdash;and she evidently did&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure the Ladybug
can make it. It&rsquo;s good hard ground all
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda sounded confident, but Dot&rsquo;s heart was
in her mouth until she saw the Ladybug actually
rise from the earth and soar up into the
skies&mdash;wherein lay safety.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Once again Linda&rsquo;s heart was singing with
rapture. She had enjoyed piloting that swift
plane of Mr. Eckert&rsquo;s, but after all, there was
nothing like her beloved Ladybug. Why, the
thing was almost human, the way it responded
to her touch!</p>
<p>Another great advantage at the present time,
when the girls had lost their way, was the autogiro&rsquo;s
ability to fly low. Now they could watch
the landscape for towns and airports and
landing-fields. Oh, it was good to have the
Ladybug back again, if she couldn&rsquo;t make a
hundred and fifty miles an hour!</p>
<p>The country was so strange, so different
from anything they were used to, that, in spite
of its barrenness, they watched it in fascination.
They came to the mountains and Linda nosed
her plane upward, over the steep slopes covered
with pine forests, until she was rewarded by
seeing little villages on the other side. Straw-roofed
houses dotted the landscape; there was
evidence of farm-life, of some kind of civilization,
though just what, the girls couldn&rsquo;t make
out from their height in the air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Linda consulted her map, and familiarized
herself with the names of several of the towns
near the mountains, determined to fly on until
she could find a good landing. She noticed the
tracks of a railroad in the distance, and this she
decided to follow, until it should lead to a station,
and be identified as a town. Her gas was
growing low, but she had no fear of a forced
landing. In country like this there would be
plenty of opportunities for an autogiro.</p>
<p>Half an hour later she hovered over a small
Mexican town that provided an airport, and
brought the Ladybug to earth.</p>
<p>A man who was obviously a Mexican came
forward to meet them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you speak English?&rdquo; asked Linda.</p>
<p>The man nodded, smiling.</p>
<p>Reassured, the girls climbed out of the cockpit,
and Dot proceeded to tell their story, asking
how she could notify the police in Los
Angeles in the quickest time, so as to have
them pursue the Sky Rocket instead of the
autogiro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can send a wire immediately, right
from here,&rdquo; the man replied. &ldquo;At least&mdash;you
can when the operator comes back. He&rsquo;s off
for supper now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a wireless operator,&rdquo; announced
Linda, calmly. &ldquo;If you are willing to trust
me, I can send my own message.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;O. K.,&rdquo; agreed the man, who was beginning
to decide that girls could do almost anything
now-a-days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I want to leave the autogiro here for
the night, and have her filled with gas and oil,&rdquo;
she continued. &ldquo;And go to some hotel for a
meal. Can you recommend one for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are several hotels,&rdquo; he replied,
proudly. &ldquo;But I will send you to the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It proved to be strangely unlike any hotel
the girls had ever visited. It was a long, low
stucco building, with stone floors on the first
story, and bare boards above. The supper, too,
was unlike American food, but it tasted good to
the hungry girls who had had nothing but a
couple of oranges since their breakfast. And
the prospect of a roof over their heads, after
their disastrous adventure of the night before,
was extremely pleasant. After their hearty
supper they sat out on the wide, roofless veranda
until the night grew cool enough for
sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where do we go from here?&rdquo; asked
Dot, wondering whether Linda had had enough
by now, and was ready to go back to Los
Angeles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;More pursuit,&rdquo; returned her companion.
&ldquo;I feel under greater obligations than ever to
catch that thief now&mdash;for she has Mr. Eckert&rsquo;s
plane. I&rsquo;m responsible for it. We&rsquo;ll fly around
to all the airports for news. Their gas supply
ought to be getting low, and they&rsquo;ll have to
stop somewhere to fill up. That&rsquo;s the clue we&rsquo;ll
have to follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could get back into the United
States,&rdquo; remarked Dot. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the bugs
here in Mexico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we can hope for that, till we
catch them. They&rsquo;re going to steer clear of
our police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; yawned Dot.
&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s go get some sleep. We can&rsquo;t tell
what adventures may be in front of us tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we can&rsquo;t possibly tell,&rdquo; agreed Linda.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">A CLOSE CALL</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; announced Linda at the breakfast
table in the Mexican hotel the following
morning, &ldquo;that we&rsquo;ll have to cross the mountains
today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dot groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pleasant little ray of sunshine you
are, Linda!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you object so to the mountains&mdash;in
broad daylight, I mean. If there are
bears and snakes in the mountains, they can&rsquo;t
attack us in the air, can they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long as we just stay up in the air, it&rsquo;s all
right. What I don&rsquo;t care about is camping out
in these wild spots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect we&rsquo;ll have to,&rdquo; Linda assured
her. &ldquo;But I am taking an extra tank of
gasoline, in case we can&rsquo;t find a place to refuel.
Meanwhile, what I want you to see about is the
food, if you will.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m to make a visit to the kitchen, I suppose?&rdquo;
inquired Dot. She made a wry face at
the cereal she was eating. &ldquo;Do you know,
Linda, I could bear most anything if only we
never had to eat another mouthful of this
hotel&rsquo;s cooking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s not exactly like the Ambassador.
Still, it&rsquo;s a lot better than nothing, and we
might be very glad to have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dot did as she was asked and raided the hotel
kitchen, ignoring the indignant protests of the
servants. Inside of half an hour the girls were
back at the airport where they had left the
autogiro, and Linda was giving the Ladybug a
thorough inspection, for she did not have much
confidence in the mechanic&rsquo;s knowledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any news of the Sky Rocket?&rdquo; she asked,
as she completed her work to her satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not a thing,&rdquo; replied the man.</p>
<p>Somewhat discouraged, the girls climbed into
the cockpits and Linda taxied a short distance
along the runway, but left the ground so quickly
that the mechanic stood there staring at the
autogiro with his mouth wide open.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>Linda directed her course south, aiming to
reach a larger airport before noon. Here she
made a landing, refueled, and again inquired
for news. A yellow biplane, it seemed, had been
sighted that morning, flying low, going west
towards the coast of the Gulf of California.
Whether it was the Sky Rocket or not, no one
could say. But at least it was a clue to follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you we&rsquo;d have to cross those mountains,&rdquo;
remarked Linda. &ldquo;But please don&rsquo;t
start to worry about them yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda changed her direction and headed the
ship west, and they flew a monotonous course
for a couple of hours. The sun glared down
upon them, and the earth below looked parched
and barren. So different from their own Ohio
country in the month of October.</p>
<p>They reached the mountains at last, and after
assuring herself that there was plenty of gas in
her reserve tanks, Linda flew dauntlessly
towards them. As she approached, she noted a
heavy cloud bank hovering directly above the
mountains, and extending so far on either side
that she gave up all thought of going around
it. Instead she put the ship into a sharp climb
and headed resolutely into it. She held the
climb until she was several thousand feet higher
to make sure of clearing the mountain safely,
but as they had failed at this height to rise
above the cloud, she leveled off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Grayness was all about them, enveloping
them like a blanket, and cutting off their view
of either the mountains or the sun. In her
powerlessness to see in this unknown region,
Linda suddenly experienced a queer choking
sensation, brought on by her helplessness.
Scolding herself for this momentary weakness,
she pulled back the joy-stick and nosed the
Ladybug still higher up. But climb as she
might, she could not get away from that cloud.</p>
<p>Dot, however, did not appear to be frightened
at all. Wasn&rsquo;t Linda always able to get the
best of almost any bad situation, even if it
were an unknown mountain range in a mist?
She was singing cheerfully to herself, when all
of a sudden, the words died on her lips.</p>
<p>Another plane was approaching&mdash;was almost
on top of them! They had not been able to see
it, because of the cloud, or to hear it, because
of the noise of their own motor. But there it
was, rushing headlong at them with the relentless
speed of an infuriated animal. Dot held
her breath and shut her eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Linda saw it too, and flashed on her lights as
a signal. But it was too late for signals; only
a miracle could save them. With a sudden
sharp turn she banked to the left, and went into
a side-slip, dropping the plane fifty feet. The
other plane passed over their heads, barely
missing the rotor blades.</p>
<p>The perspiration had collected on her face in
beads, and her hands were hot and moist. It
had been a narrow escape!</p>
<p>But it evidently wasn&rsquo;t over. Or could it be
another plane? For the thing was almost upon
her again, as if it, too, had dropped on purpose.
She couldn&rsquo;t believe her ears. Was it that girl&mdash;and
had she recognized the rotor blades of
the autogiro, and was trying to force Linda to
land?</p>
<p>Her heart in her mouth, she banked again,
dropping for the second time, determined to
land now at any cost. The strain had been
awful the first time, but now it actually unnerved
her. Inside of that cloud&mdash;on the
dangerous mountain side! No; she could not
take another chance, not only with her own life,
but with Dot&rsquo;s. Wherever she came down, it
couldn&rsquo;t be as dangerous as this.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>Gradually throttling her engine down to a
slower speed, she began her descent by a series
of glides. All the while watching for a glimpse
of the solid earth beneath her.</p>
<p>Down, down they came, but still there was no
ground visible. They must have passed over
the mountains, she decided, and were descending
into a valley. Or level ground, perhaps.
That thought was encouraging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is!&rdquo; shouted Dot, almost hysterically.
&ldquo;The earth, I mean!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda breathed a deep sigh of relief. Never
before had she been so thankful to see it, unless
perhaps the first time she had made a parachute
jump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be the plateau!&rdquo; she cried, joyfully.
&ldquo;We must have passed over the mountains!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gently the autogiro settled down to a landing
on the level ground beneath them. It was a
fertile spot in comparison with the other places
in Mexico where they had landed. The earth
was not nearly so parched or barren, and here
and there, between the underbrush and the bare
spots, a kind of coarse grass was growing.
Perhaps, Linda thought, the land was used by
someone for grazing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a pleasant spot,&rdquo; remarked Dot
gaily, as if they had been on a picnic instead of
face to face with death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See the mountains over there?&rdquo; asked
Linda, for they were out of the range of the
cloud through which they had just passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But they&rsquo;re far enough away that I
really don&rsquo;t mind. If a bear wanders over to
visit us, we&rsquo;ll feed him some Mexican food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They climbed out of the cockpits, carrying
their box of provisions in their arms, when they
saw a sight that made them stand breathless in
horror. About five hundred yards away they
beheld a great mass of flame, shooting up to
the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a plane!&rdquo; exclaimed Linda. &ldquo;It must
be the one we almost crashed against.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With one thought in mind, the girls both
dropped their box and started to run. Oh, if a
human being were caged in that burning cockpit!
It was too dreadful to think of&mdash;a death
like that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>But before they had covered fifty yards of
the intervening distance, they saw a parachute
floating down to the earth. They stopped instantly,
waiting in breathless suspense. Suppose
it were Sprague, with his supply of chloroform?
Tensely alert, Linda pulled her revolver
from her belt.</p>
<p>But it was not Sprague. The man who
floated down let out a cry of horror when he
recognized Linda and Dot. Though why he
should be so horrified, the girls did not know.</p>
<p>The man was Bertram Chase!</p>
<p>He disentangled himself from his ropes,
glanced at his burning plane, and let out a
groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;And to think, I almost
killed you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t help that,&rdquo; said Linda gently.
&ldquo;It seems we almost did for you, too. If you
hadn&rsquo;t jumped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t your fault. My plane caught
on fire somehow&mdash;a leak, I think, in the gas
feed. That&rsquo;s why I jumped.... But that had
nothing to do with you.... But I actually
tried to force you down&mdash;the second time, I
mean. The first was accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; asked Dot, incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw your rotors, the first time I passed
over you. And knew it was the autogiro. And
thought that girl was piloting it, of course.
How did you girls ever get hold of it again?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you didn&rsquo;t get the report from the
Los Angeles headquarters?&rdquo; inquired Linda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What report?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we exchanged planes. My double
stole our Sky Rocket, and left us the Ladybug
instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And got away with it?&rdquo; demanded Chase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. We&rsquo;re still after them. But where
have you been in the meanwhile?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flying around these mountains, without
any touch of civilization. I even made a search
on foot, but it proved to be a false clue that I
was following. But tell me the story, while we
take a walk over and examine my poor ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Briefly Dot related the facts of the night-adventure
with Sprague and his wife, as the
three young fliers approached the burning
mass. The flames had somewhat subsided, and
only a smoking, blackened frame remained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it yours, Mr. Chase?&rdquo; asked Linda
sympathetically, thinking how dreadful she
would feel if it were the Ladybug.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;It belonged to the secret
service. It was an old boat, but I was fond of
it. And I&rsquo;ve lost a lot of my things.... I
think,&rdquo; he added, gloomily, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;d better
hunt about for some water, to put the fire entirely
out. I don&rsquo;t want to start a prairie fire,
or whatever you call it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose there is a stream anywhere
about?&rdquo; asked Linda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so. If we&rsquo;ve got to stay here for the
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come back to the Ladybug and get a
can to fill, in case you do find water. Bring
some back to us, if possible, and then we&rsquo;ll give
you some supper. Real Mexican food&mdash;if you
like it.&rdquo; It was Dot who made this offer, and
she winked slyly at Linda as she concluded.</p>
<p>The young man wandered off, and the girls
turned to their preparations for supper. The
food had already been cooked, so they decided
to eat it cold.</p>
<p>It was some time before Chase returned with
the can of water and the announcement that he
had found a stream, and had succeeded in putting
out the fire. He sat down gloomily beside
the girls, but he made no motion to eat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so sad, Mr. Chase,&rdquo; said Dot.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll give you another plane.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; he replied, morosely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
my foolhardiness. When I think of what I did
to you, I&rsquo;d like to shoot myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked so pathetic, so utterly downcast,
that Linda didn&rsquo;t know what to say. But Dot,
in her characteristic manner, tried teasing him.
Very solemnly she handed him Linda&rsquo;s pistol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you really want to shoot yourself, go off
away from us, where you won&rsquo;t clutter up the
landscape!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man laughed in spite of himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snap out of it, Bert!&rdquo; she commanded,
using his first name on purpose. &ldquo;And have
some of this delicious Mexican food. I don&rsquo;t
know its name, but it tastes like week-old hash
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smiling again, Chase accepted the paper
plate she held out to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just imagine, Bert,&rdquo; Dot continued, afraid
to stop talking lest he become sad again, &ldquo;that
we&rsquo;re here on a picnic, with the autogiro, and
this delicious supper. And you&rsquo;re lucky enough
to be the young man chosen&mdash;out of hundreds
of admirers of Miss Linda Carlton! Why, you
have no idea how many young men in this country
would give their best hats to have your
chance!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>Linda flushed at this remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Dot,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re being
silly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not. I&rsquo;ll enumerate them, if you like.
There&rsquo;s Ralph Clavering, and Harriman Smith,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Dot!&rdquo; cried her chum, putting her
hand over her mouth. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s about enough
out of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chase, who by this time was grinning
broadly, bowed in acknowledgment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All joking aside,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I realize what
an honor it is. And that&rsquo;s just why I feel so
rotten about doing those two mean things to
you, Linda.&rdquo; He was so in earnest that he did
not realize that he had used her first name.
&ldquo;Accusing you of forgery the first time I saw
you, and then almost killing you. You, who
have never done anything wrong in your whole
life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now, that&rsquo;s putting it on a little bit
too thick!&rdquo; remonstrated Dot. &ldquo;Linda&rsquo;s not
such a saint as that. I remember many a time
that she climbed cherry trees that didn&rsquo;t belong
to her, and skinned out of school&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough about me,&rdquo; interrupted
Linda. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting so dark, I think we ought
to make our plans for the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we have to stay here,&rdquo; remarked
Dot, with a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the sigh?&rdquo; asked Chase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t care for camping out&mdash;in
Mexico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you&mdash;after being chloroformed,&rdquo;
sympathized Chase. &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t
have to, tonight. For I found a straw-covered
shack over near the stream where I got our
water. You girls can have that. I&rsquo;ll stay up
here, beside the autogiro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have redeemed yourself, Bert!&rdquo; exclaimed
Dot, jumping to her feet, and shaking
his hand. &ldquo;For one night at least, we&rsquo;ll be
safe!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">FLIRTING WITH DEATH</span></h2>
<p>The little Mexican adobe house which Bert
Chase had discovered was the funniest Linda
and Dot had ever seen. A one-room affair,
with a slanting straw-covered roof, and no
windows. Only two doors, opening back and
front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d almost rather sleep under the stars,&rdquo;
remarked Linda. &ldquo;For there are probably all
sorts of bugs in the corners and cracks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dot shivered. &ldquo;Still, bugs are better than
bears and snakes, that might come wandering
down from those mountains,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And
besides, it would be ungrateful not to use the
house after Bert found it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be protection from the sun in the
morning,&rdquo; added Linda. &ldquo;Because this Mexican
climate gets pretty hot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>So, spreading their blankets on the floor and
propping the doors open with sticks, they lay
down on their hard bed and fell fast asleep,
not to awaken until quite late the following
morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fog again!&rdquo; yawned Dot, as she finally got
up stiffly and walked to the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of
these fogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll probably clear up soon,&rdquo; Linda reminded
her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read that early morning
fogs are the common thing in this part of the
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hunt that stream Bert was talking
about, and get a good wash,&rdquo; suggested Dot.
&ldquo;Before we go back to the autogiro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found it not far from the little house,
and although it was shallow and narrow, the
water was clear and refreshing. They felt
much better as they made their way back to the
spot where the Ladybug had landed.</p>
<p>For several minutes they could see nothing
because of the fog, and they began to feel
worried. Suppose something had happened to
Chase or to the autogiro during the night!
What a desolate place to be stranded!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>Before these dismal thoughts could really
take hold of them, they spied the dim outlines
of the Ladybug, shadowy in the fog. She was
still there! Their means of escape.</p>
<p>Dot placed her hands at her mouth, and gave
a war-whoop for Chase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo-ho-ho-ho-Bert!&rdquo; she shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo-ho, girls!&rdquo; came the reassuring reply.
&ldquo;This way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they distinguished a fire, and a moment
later, came upon him, contentedly cooking a
fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get it?&rdquo; demanded Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caught it. Early this morning,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;I felt guilty about eating so much of your
food last night, so I tried to get a contribution.
That stream widens out about a mile below
your little house, so I went down and tried my
luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a peach!&rdquo; exclaimed Dot. &ldquo;Because
all we have left is coffee and that terrible
Mexican bread. It&rsquo;s a wonder they don&rsquo;t learn
how to bake in Mexico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It surely smells good,&rdquo; observed Linda.
&ldquo;How soon can we eat?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as you girls make the coffee. I
brought up a fresh supply of water this morning.
We&rsquo;ll boil some of it, to take along with
us for drinking, while we have the chance to
do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It turned out to be a delicious as well as a
merry meal. While they ate, the fog gradually
lifted, bringing a clear, if hot day, for their
flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be pretty near the coast of the
Gulf of California,&rdquo; said Linda. &ldquo;So I think
perhaps our best plan would be to fly across to
the peninsula. I have an idea that girl is going
to abandon the Sky Rocket as soon as she can,
for it&rsquo;s pretty conspicuous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would she do to get away, if she
hadn&rsquo;t a plane?&rdquo; demanded Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hide somewhere, or take a boat for South
America perhaps. Now that she and her husband
are out of the United States, it would be
easy enough for them to book passage on a
small steamer&mdash;without being noticed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your autogiro in good condition?&rdquo; inquired
Chase. &ldquo;I mean&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t damage it
yesterday, did I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. You know you never touched me. But
I&rsquo;ll look her over before we start. And put in
that tank of extra gas I was carrying in the
passenger&rsquo;s cockpit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I could help you?&rdquo; suggested the
young man. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about the inside
workings of a plane, but maybe two heads
are better than one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dot let out a peal of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Linda is a graduate airplane mechanic,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;She is the only woman in the country
with a mechanic&rsquo;s license!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chase stared in open-mouthed amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I do take off my
hat to you, Miss Linda Carlton!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better!&rdquo; laughed Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be so silly,&rdquo; put in Linda, anxious
to be off. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all go over to the Ladybug
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Dot put the equipment into the autogiro,
Chase filled the gasoline tank and Linda
gave the boat a hasty inspection. Apparently
everything was ship-shape.</p>
<p>They climbed into the cockpits and Linda
started the rotors in motion. It was Chase&rsquo;s
first experience in an autogiro, and he watched
her with absorbed interest. The ease with
which the Ladybug rose into the air seemed
nothing short of miraculous to him, accustomed
as he was to the prolonged taxi-ing of a
fast plane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>With the aid of her maps and compass, Linda
was able to judge their location pretty definitely,
and she flew westward to the Gulf of
California, aiming to stop first at an airport to
make inquiries about the Sky Rocket, and to
refuel. They passed over the plateau, and
caught glimpses of several Mexican villages,
which, however, seemed too small to boast of
airports. At last, however, about noon, she
spotted a town of some size, with beacon sign-posts,
pointing to an airport. Here she made
her landing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be out of luck if they don&rsquo;t speak
English,&rdquo; remarked Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that,&rdquo; returned Chase.
&ldquo;I can speak Spanish, and they all understand
that down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t necessary, for one of the attendants
at the field spoke English perfectly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen a yellow biplane?&rdquo; demanded
Dot, as the man came out of the
hangar. &ldquo;A fast plane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The attendant nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I did. We got a radio
yesterday, telling us to be on the look-out for a
stolen plane. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I saw her yesterday,
but she didn&rsquo;t stop here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; remarked Dot, bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What direction did she take?&rdquo; asked Linda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Straight across the Gulf. Due west.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Due west for us, then,&rdquo; announced Linda.
&ldquo;Fill up my tanks, for we want to leave with
all possible speed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inside of ten minutes they were off again,
more encouraged than they had been since the
beginning of their pursuit. It looked now as if
they really might catch those criminals.</p>
<p>In their eagerness to follow hot on the trail,
not one of the three fliers even thought of lunch.
Later in the day they were to regret this omission
sorely.</p>
<p>An hour of flying brought them to the coast,
but Linda did not stop. Out over the water she
flew, her heart beating rapidly with the expectation
of victory ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>But in her excitement, she had not realized
how wide the Gulf of California was at this
southern part. Two hundred miles, at least, if
she kept her course straight. She had covered
only a little more than half of this, when she
saw to her horror that her main tank was exhausted.
Twelve gallons of gas in the
emergency supply, and almost a hundred miles
to go!</p>
<p>What a fool she had been, not to put an extra
tank into the cockpit! To think that after all
her experience, she should be endangering three
lives by her carelessness! To be forced down
in the water! To meet death in a way she had
not thought of, since her flight across the Atlantic
Ocean!</p>
<p>She slowed down her speed and gazed all
about her at the limitless expanse of water beneath
them. No land in sight&mdash;not even a boat
to which she could signal. Parachute jumping
would be of no use, and she did not carry life-preservers.</p>
<p>She glanced again at the indicator; conserving
gas as well as she could, it was nevertheless
rapidly disappearing. Ten minutes more, perhaps&mdash;and
then a watery grave! She grew panicky,
more for her companions than for herself.
She would have to tell them of their fate.</p>
<p>Trying to keep her voice from shaking, she
called into the speaking-tube:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re out of gas. We have to come down.
Be prepared to jump clear of the ship!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chase and Dot looked at each other in incredulity.
The young man thought Linda was
joking, but the girl knew that it was not her
chum&rsquo;s habit to make ghastly jokes. If Linda
said danger, she meant it. Desperately Dot
reached for the glasses and peered anxiously
about them in all directions.</p>
<p>Linda, her lips tight and her heart tense, continued
to guide the plane and to watch the indicator.
Five minutes more, perhaps&mdash;and
then&mdash;what? The hungry waves, tossing beneath
her, seemed to make their greedy answer.</p>
<p>A sudden hysterical cry from Dot sounded
above the roar of the motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land!&rdquo; she shouted, wildly. &ldquo;Bank to the
right!&rdquo; And then, fearing that Linda had not
heard her, she repeated her message through
the speaking-tube.</p>
<p>Although Linda could still see nothing with
her naked eye, she did as she was told, thankful
that she was high enough in the air to gain
considerable distance by gliding. Two minutes
passed; the gas ran dry, but now the island
was in sight. By careful manipulation, Linda
thought she could make it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>With a series of side-slips, she gradually
made her approach, coming nearer and nearer
to the land as she descended, until she was actually
over it. Then, with a dead-stick landing,
so much easier with an autogiro than with an
ordinary plane, she slowly came down on the
sandy soil of the beach!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank Heaven!&rdquo; cried Dot, in an ecstasy
of relief. &ldquo;A miracle, if there ever was
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chase said nothing for a moment; he was
speechless with admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty tight squeeze,&rdquo; admitted Linda, as
she wiped the perspiration from her face. &ldquo;If
it hadn&rsquo;t been for you, Dot, I&rsquo;d never have
seen it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still trembling from their experience, the
girls climbed out of the cockpits with Chase&rsquo;s
assistance. At last the young man found words
to express his admiration to Linda. But she
was too ashamed of her lack of foresight to
accept any praise. She was still terribly vexed
with herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll have to explore,&rdquo; announced Dot.
&ldquo;Do you suppose anybody lives on this island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; replied Chase. &ldquo;Or they&rsquo;d
have been here to see us by this time. It looks
pretty barren and forsaken to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No trees! No shade at all!&rdquo; added Dot.</p>
<p>Nothing, indeed, but a dry underbrush, and
the sort of weeds that grow in sandy soil. The
little group walked all around the island, and
found it to be very small. Probably it was not
even shown on most maps, though Linda did recall
seeing some dots in the southern part of
the Gulf. And of course nobody lived there.</p>
<p>Dismally they came back to the beach where
the Ladybug was resting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any food left at all?&rdquo; asked Chase,
trying not to appear too eager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a crumb,&rdquo; replied Dot. &ldquo;Though we
do still have about a gallon of water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing to do,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is to climb
up on the plane and hoist a signal of distress.
So we&rsquo;ll catch a ship, if one goes past. If you&rsquo;ll
get me something to put....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>He glanced shyly at the girls. As they were
both in khaki flying-suits, there was no chance
of using a white skirt or petticoat, as he had so
often read of, in books about ship-wreck. But
Linda immediately procured a large square of
canvas which she kept on hand for repair, and
he did the climbing at once.</p>
<p>When he came down again, he produced the
fishing-line which he had improvised that morning
and set about to try to catch a fish. Linda
spent her time inspecting the plane, and Dot
went about gathering underbrush for a fire, in
case Chase was lucky enough to secure a catch.</p>
<p>Each of the three had taken a deep drink of
water, resolutely trying to stave off their hunger
by that means.</p>
<p>An hour passed, and another, without any
sign of a boat, and the girls began to wonder
whether they would have to spend the night on
this tiny island, without any food. They were
sitting back on the beach, near to the autogiro,
talking a little, and searching the waters often
with the glasses for the sight of a ship. The
sun was already low against the horizon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how far we are from the peninsula,&rdquo;
remarked Dot. &ldquo;Maybe we could swim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on an empty stomach,&rdquo; returned Linda.
&ldquo;Besides, we must be pretty far. According to
my figures.... Oh, look, Dot!&rdquo; She jumped
gaily to her feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;What! A boat?&rdquo; cried her companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Only Bert&mdash;with a fish! But it surely
does look good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light your fire, Dot!&rdquo; the young man called
as he approached. &ldquo;The fish is cleaned&mdash;all
ready to fry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an ace!&rdquo; returned the girl, looking
admiringly at the young man in his flier&rsquo;s suit,
and his rumpled hair and cheery smile. How
different he looked from the first time the girls
had seen him&mdash;as a stern detective in Von
Goss&rsquo;s office. It didn&rsquo;t seem possible that they
had known him only a few days.</p>
<p>She lighted the fire, and half an hour later
they ate their scanty supper. If anyone had
ever told them that fish without any bread, or
even salt, would taste good, they would not
have believed it. But now they found it extremely
satisfying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going right back again,&rdquo; said Chase,
when they had finished eating. &ldquo;If I have to
fish all night, I&rsquo;m determined to get something
for your breakfast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;won&rsquo;t&mdash;have&mdash;to,&rdquo; announced Linda,
slowly, handing her glasses to Dot. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure
I see a boat!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">THE ENEMY PLANE</span></h2>
<p>The three young fliers stood on the beach,
waiting for the approaching boat in excited
suspense. She was nearer now; there was no
doubt that she was answering their signal.</p>
<p>It was a large, flat steamboat with wide decks,
which were packed with passengers who were
peering at the lonely little island, and waving
cheerily at the three survivors. It approached
rapidly; when it was within calling distance of
the island it stopped and let down a life-boat,
which two men rowed to the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we all get aboard?&rdquo; inquired Dot,
turning to Linda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d rather not,&rdquo; replied Linda. &ldquo;If
they can supply us with some food, I think I&rsquo;d
better stay here. You see, I don&rsquo;t like to leave
the Ladybug alone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suggest, Linda?&rdquo; asked
Chase, as if he, too, considered her the guide in
this situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you go to the mainland, Bert&mdash;or to
the peninsula, whichever the boat happens to
be headed for&mdash;and bring me back some gas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean leave you two girls here alone?&rdquo;
he asked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll mean all night&mdash;before I can
get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Why not? We&rsquo;ll be safe, unless a
shark comes to shore and bites us. But for
goodness&rsquo; sake, don&rsquo;t forget us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget you,&rdquo; replied the young
man solemnly.</p>
<p>The life-boat had reached the island by this
time, and two men jumped out and leaped to
shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is wonderful of you!&rdquo; cried Dot. &ldquo;We
certainly are grateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to do it,&rdquo; replied one of the men, a
big, brawny sailor. &ldquo;But do tell me what that
thing is.&rdquo; He pointed to the autogiro. &ldquo;It
looks like a plane, but I never seen a plane like
that before.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an autogiro,&rdquo; explained Chase. &ldquo;And
we ran out of gas&mdash;almost dropped down in the
Gulf.... So, if you can take me to shore, I&rsquo;d
like to get some and bring it back here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; replied the man. &ldquo;But what about
the ladies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve decided to stay here,&rdquo; replied Dot.
&ldquo;At least, if you can supply us with some food
to keep us till tomorrow morning. We&rsquo;re nearly
starved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; repeated the man, &ldquo;anything you
say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chase and the two sailors climbed into the
rowboat and pushed off immediately. Inside
of ten minutes they returned, bringing a box of
food with them, and a tank of ice-water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much do we owe you?&rdquo; inquired
Linda, taking a bill from her pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;!&rdquo; answered the man. &ldquo;The Captain
says it&rsquo;s a present, with his compliments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s awfully good of him,&rdquo; said
Dot, lifting the lid of the box and peering hungrily
inside. &ldquo;And it looks like real American
food, too. Biscuits&mdash;and ham&mdash;and eggs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mexican chickens lay the same kind of eggs
that American chickens do,&rdquo; observed Chase,
dryly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be enough out of you!&rdquo; retorted
Dot, trying to look scornful, but laughing in
spite of herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be sure to get something to eat for yourself,
right away, Bert,&rdquo; put in Linda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take care of that,&rdquo; the sailor assured
her, as the men returned to the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And come back soon!&rdquo; added Dot.</p>
<p>The rowboat went back to the steamer, and
the girls remained on the beach watching it, all
the while waving and smiling to their rescuers.
At last the steamboat pulled off, and disappeared
from view; then they returned to
their fire and built it up again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is going to be a meal worth eating!&rdquo;
exclaimed Dot, as she unpacked biscuits and
butter, ham, eggs, and coffee. &ldquo;Even oranges
and bananas!&rdquo; she added, hardly able to wait
until they should begin to eat.</p>
<p>They sat about their fire talking until long
after darkness came on, and the stars appeared
in the sky. Both girls felt happy now&mdash;only
anxious to be after their enemy again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry for the delay,&rdquo; remarked
Linda. &ldquo;More on Mr. Eckert&rsquo;s account than
my own. If I could only get his plane back, I
shouldn&rsquo;t worry so much about that forged
check for five thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the idea of what that girl got away
with that exasperates me,&rdquo; said Dot. &ldquo;Making
all that money on your name. It&rsquo;s maddening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s sure to be caught sometime, by
the police. And then she&rsquo;ll have to pay up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I want her caught soon&mdash;and by us,
if possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, tomorrow&rsquo;s a new day,&rdquo; said Linda
hopefully. &ldquo;And you never can tell what will
happen. Now&mdash;let&rsquo;s get some sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, wrapping up in their blankets, they lay
down in the sand, far inland, lest the tide
should rise, and slept until the sun awakened
them. A delightfully cool breeze was blowing
from the ocean, reminding the girls of pleasant
days at the seashore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only it reminds me more of that island off
the coast of Georgia,&rdquo; returned Dot, when
Linda made this observation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does look something like it. But oh, such
different circumstances now. We&rsquo;re not Robinson
Crusoes here. We&rsquo;ve got everything we
want&mdash;food, and the Ladybug, and Bert Chase
to rescue us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of Bert,&rdquo; put in Dot, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get a
good swim before he gets back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They acted upon the suggestion immediately,
and enjoyed their dip immensely. What a thrill
it gave them to bathe for the first time in the
Gulf of California! Almost like going into the
Pacific Ocean. But they did not venture out
far, or stay long in the water. They wanted to
be all ready for Chase when he returned, so
that they could be on their pursuit again as
quickly as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like your boy-friend, Linda,&rdquo; said Dot,
taking up the conversation where they had left
it when they went in to bathe. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s nice
to have him out of the way for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you call him <i>my</i> boy-friend,&rdquo;
returned the other girl. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just
as much yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not! Haven&rsquo;t you noticed how he&rsquo;s
always watching you? As if he couldn&rsquo;t take
his eyes from you. Pure devotion, I&rsquo;d call it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda laughed and began to run a comb
through her wet hair, arranging the ringlets in
place. She had a lovely natural wave&mdash;a gift
which saved her a great deal of time at hairdressers&rsquo;.
No matter where she was, or how
she was dressed, she always looked pretty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re exaggerating, Dot. He&rsquo;s
never said anything to make me think he especially
likes me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the more credit to him! But just the
same, I&rsquo;ll bet Ralph Clavering wouldn&rsquo;t feel
any too easy about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Linda sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; demanded Dot. &ldquo;That
wasn&rsquo;t a sigh of hunger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t. The mention of Ralph made
me feel just a little bit homesick. Not for him
especially&mdash;but for the whole crowd, and for
Aunt Emily and Daddy. We&rsquo;ve only been gone
about ten days, but it seems ages and ages!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because so much has happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and because we have been in such
strange places. And the days have been long
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose everybody is doing by
now?&rdquo; inquired Dot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;Most of them are at college, I suppose.
Sue Emery and Sara Wheeler are rooming together.
And Jim and Ralph both must have
gone back. I don&rsquo;t know about Harriman
Smith. The last letter I had from him, he said
he wasn&rsquo;t sure whether he&rsquo;d have enough
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a nice boy,&rdquo; was Dot&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the best,&rdquo; replied Linda, with unusual
enthusiasm for her. &ldquo;But Dot,&rdquo; she continued,
as they began to make their fire for
breakfast, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you regret not going to
college?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not a bit. I get lots more thrills batting
about the country on adventures with you.
If I were at college, and learned that you were
suddenly off to California&mdash;or to the North
Pole, I&rsquo;d be absolutely sick with jealousy. I&rsquo;d
probably drop everything and go. And then,
of course, college would drop me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an old peach, Dot!&rdquo; exclaimed
Linda, giving her chum a hug. &ldquo;But some day
I &rsquo;spose I&rsquo;ll have to lose you, as I did Lou.
Jim&rsquo;ll decide that he just won&rsquo;t wait any
longer, and you&rsquo;ll be going up the aisle to the
tune of Lohengrin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dot dimpled, but shook her head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t worry about that, Linda,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;But if the time ever comes, I&rsquo;ll tell
you what you can do: Get married yourself!
And then you&rsquo;ll have a chum who won&rsquo;t ever
desert you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure about that&mdash;these days....
Now, shall we have our breakfast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all for it,&rdquo; agreed Dot, sitting down to
the pleasant meal they had just cooked.</p>
<p>The boat bringing Chase with the gasoline
did not arrive until eleven o&rsquo;clock. It took
some little time to get the tanks of gasoline
into shore, for the men dared load only one at
a time on the rowboat. And Chase had brought
three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greetings!&rdquo; he called to the girls, as the
small boat approached. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still alive?
Nothing happened during the night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dot laughed merrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sound like Linda&rsquo;s aunt, Bert. She
always expects the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t really think there was anything
much you girls couldn&rsquo;t conquer. Only
something like a big tide, that would sweep the
whole island away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He filled the empty tanks of the autogiro, and
put the other two cans into the passenger&rsquo;s
cockpit. As soon as the rowboat pulled off, the
young man turned excitedly to the girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got hot news!&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;A
yellow biplane was sighted yesterday, flying
with all possible speed towards the Pacific
Ocean. I got that from Los Angeles headquarters
last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda&rsquo;s eyes sparkled with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be right after them,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Oh,
if we&rsquo;re only not too late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a peach of a day,&rdquo; commented Dot.
&ldquo;If it is hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heat doesn&rsquo;t bother me,&rdquo; returned Linda,
climbing into the cockpit, and setting the rotors
in motion. &ldquo;Get in&mdash;if you&rsquo;re coming with
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda gave her the gun, and the Ladybug
left the beach a minute or so later, soaring triumphantly
into the skies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to fly high, now!&rdquo; shouted
Linda. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;re going to make speed!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>The outlines of the island faded and disappeared
from their sight; even the water was
lost to their view. The Ladybug flew as if she
were on a test flight, to prove her ability to
take part in any kind of service. Mile after
mile disappeared as Linda watched her instruments
and her map closely, for now she could
figure just about how far she had to go to reach
the coast of the peninsula. All the while Dot
scanned the air with the glasses, looking for a
flash of yellow in the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are over an airport town now,&rdquo; Linda
announced about one o&rsquo;clock. &ldquo;Shall we come
down for lunch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; returned her companions. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
dig out something from the box, and eat as we
go. On to the coast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They continued onward for an hour or so,
landing once to refuel from an extra tank of
gas. Now Linda dipped lower, anxious to
watch the landscape, for she knew that she
must be very near to the Pacific Ocean. She
identified the roofs of a village&mdash;a little seaport
town, probably&mdash;and yes&mdash;there was the ocean
beyond!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d go south for a while, Linda!&rdquo; Chase advised.
&ldquo;The report was that the Sky Rocket
was headed southwest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Linda banked and directed her course
along the coast to the southward. Flying low,
and watching the ground for an airport.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>From the air they were able to identify scattered
seaside huts, and even fishing boats out
on the ocean. But no town of any size, and no
sign of an airport.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to land and make inquiries,&rdquo;
Linda was thinking to herself, when Dot suddenly
let out a piercing scream. Terrified,
Linda looked all about her, thinking they must
be rushing headlong into some awful peril.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see the plane!&rdquo; Dot cried, frantically.
&ldquo;Over there on the beach&mdash;to the left!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda peered out to the side her chum indicated,
but she could distinguish nothing but a
blurred outline of green.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sky Rocket!&rdquo; screamed Dot. &ldquo;Bank
to the left!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though she still failed to see it with her
naked eye, Linda&rsquo;s heart beat rapidly with the
thrill of success, and she took the direction Dot
indicated. She dipped lower, and banked to the
left, approaching the spot slowly. And then,
sure enough, she saw it for herself. The Sky
Rocket!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>The beach was wide and the plane stood
erect, as if all ready for a take-off. Suppose
it sailed off this moment! Before Linda could
get to it! The Sky Rocket was bigger, faster,
newer than the Ladybug&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t it be sure
to get away in a race?</p>
<p>While these thoughts were running through
her head, she kept her eyes glued upon the
plane, approaching it cautiously. Nearer and
nearer she came&mdash;but still the Sky Rocket did
not move. What was Sprague&rsquo;s game now?
Would he wait for her to land, and shoot from
under cover?</p>
<p>Down&mdash;down the Ladybug came. To death?
Or at least a struggle? Reaching instinctively
for her revolver, Linda landed the autogiro on
the beach, about a hundred yards from the
enemy plane.... And&mdash;waited!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">HOT ON THE TRAIL</span></h2>
<p>Chase, his hand on his revolver, climbed
out of the autogiro and slipped cautiously
around the side. He kept his eyes riveted on
the Sky Rocket, but there was no movement
whatsoever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re probably hiding,&rdquo; he whispered,
as the noise of the rotors died out. &ldquo;You girls
stay right here, and creep up on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dot and Linda did as they were told. In
tense silence they watched the young man advance
nearer and nearer to the Sky Rocket, expecting
every moment to hear a shot ring out
from the underbrush that grew along the
beach.</p>
<p>It was a deserted spot; there were no cottages
or boathouses about. The only sound
was the breaking of the waves, with monotonous
regularity, upon the shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>Chase got nearer and nearer; he actually
came up to the yellow plane, and peered all
around it. Still there was no sign of human
life anywhere. He looked into the cockpit; then
he sauntered towards the scattered bushes on
the beach, examining them with his glasses.
And still nothing happened.</p>
<p>Unable to bear the suspense any longer, the
girls came out from behind the Ladybug and
started to advance towards the Sky Rocket.
At the same time Chase, satisfied that the
enemy was nowhere about, proceeded slowly
back to meet them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re too late again,&rdquo; he observed, gloomily.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve abandoned it, there&rsquo;s no doubt
of that. Evidently got scared and decided to
leave it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Running up to the plane, Linda began to examine
it eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to be in good condition,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;And that certainly is a lucky break. If I
couldn&rsquo;t get both, I&rsquo;d rather have the plane
than the girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chase regarded her in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she has your money!&rdquo; was his comment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know. But I care more about Mr. Eckert&rsquo;s
plane&mdash;it&rsquo;s worth a whole lot more than
five thousand dollars. And he was such a good
sport to lend it to me. I can just imagine how
dreadfully he&rsquo;d feel, if he thought he&rsquo;d never
see it again. I know how I felt when I lost the
Ladybug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where do you suppose they have
gone?&rdquo; asked Dot. &ldquo;The Spragues, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda dropped down to a sitting position on
the sand and fished in her pocket for a map.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have taken a boat from somewhere
near here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So if we can
find out where we are, and the nearest seaport
town, we might be able to catch them before
they sail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re pretty far south on this peninsula,&rdquo;
put in Chase, looking over Linda&rsquo;s shoulder at
the map.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so.... You know what I believe
would be best, Bert? If the Sky Rocket is in
good condition&mdash;we&rsquo;ll look her over in a minute
and find out&mdash;one of us could fly her south
along the coast, and another take the Ladybug
north. In that way we ought to pick up news
of our honeymooners pretty quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea!&rdquo; returned Chase, immediately.
&ldquo;Which plane do you want, Linda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d rather have the Sky Rocket,&rdquo;
returned the girl. &ldquo;If you can manage the
Ladybug. Because if I should find out that
the Spragues have sailed somewhere in a boat,
I might like to pursue them. And the Sky
Rocket can go so much faster, and carry enough
gas for a trip across the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all one to me,&rdquo; agreed Chase. &ldquo;If
you&rsquo;ll trust me with the Ladybug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Linda assured him. &ldquo;Now I
think I&rsquo;ll go look the Sky Rocket over, and
tighten some of those wires that I see out of
&lsquo;stream-line&rsquo;. That makes a lot of difference,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda finished her job in less than an hour,
and after they had eaten the remainder of their
food supply, she gave Chase a few instructions
about flying the autogiro. Satisfied that he
knew how to manage it, the girls insisted that
he take off first, flying back north along the sea-coast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when you&rsquo;re through, you can park
the Ladybug at the Los Angeles airport,&rdquo; concluded
Linda. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pick her up there, after the
girl has been caught&mdash;by us, or somebody else.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>She and Dot stood watching the young man
take off and soar into the air, until he was
finally lost to sight. Once again they were
alone, but with more hope of success than they
had had before. Now both planes had been regained,
and they had the Sky Rocket to rely on.
They felt, with it, that they had the world&mdash;or
better still, the air&mdash;at their command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be a seaport pretty near here,&rdquo;
said Linda, as she and Dot climbed into the
powerful yellow plane. &ldquo;If the Spragues
haven&rsquo;t left from there, they at least ought to
be able to find out by wire what vessels have
left the coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flew straight down to Cape San Lucas, a
seaport town, which boasted of a sizable airport.
It was terribly hot here, when she
brought the plane to the ground; the heat
seemed to rise in waves to hit them in the face
as the girls climbed out of the cockpits. For
the airport was located behind the town, and
that morning no ocean breezes brought cooling
refreshment to landward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>It was a large airport, and it kept attendants
who could speak all the principal languages.
The man who came forward, a dark Mexican,
surprised the girls by speaking perfect English.</p>
<p>Briefly Linda told him the facts of her story&mdash;about
the stolen planes, which had since
been regained, and the forged check for five
thousand dollars. But she said nothing about
the part in the talking-picture, or of the girl&rsquo;s
having taken her name. There was no reason,
she felt, for emphasizing that point or drawing
publicity to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we think this couple have sailed,&rdquo; she
concluded. &ldquo;Though under what name, we
don&rsquo;t know. Probably neither Sprague nor
Bower, but something else, to fool us, and
throw the police off the track. Our first desire
is to find out what big vessels have left this
vicinity today or yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get in touch with the docks immediately,&rdquo;
the man assured her. &ldquo;Though I think
can tell you myself. A vessel named the
&lsquo;Mona&rsquo; left here yesterday for Hawaii. There
isn&rsquo;t another until day after tomorrow, which
sails for South America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda&rsquo;s eyes shone with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hawaii!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I always did
want to fly the Pacific!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t try it!&rdquo; he cried, in horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a
matter of about two thousand miles&mdash;less than
a non-stop flight across the United States. And
I have a marvellous plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;this?&rdquo; he asked, pointing to the
Sky Rocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. She&rsquo;s a marvel, even if she has only
one motor. She can make a hundred and fifty
miles an hour, and is equipped with all the newest
inventions and improvements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see that.... But the danger&mdash;in any
kind of plane,&rdquo; he remonstrated. &ldquo;No woman
has ever attempted it, and plenty of airmen
have found a watery grave in the Pacific.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, some woman has to be first,&rdquo; returned
Linda. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think about it, anyway.
In the meanwhile, I think I&rsquo;ll go down to have
a talk with the men at the docks.... By the
way, have you an expert mechanic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very best!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then please have him give the Sky Rocket
a thorough inspection. Doubly thorough, for
tell him what I am contemplating. And have
him take a look at the wireless that is already
installed. And fill her up with gas and oil.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;O. K.,&rdquo; agreed the man, shaking his head
as if he thought Linda were crazy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;and could you get me a rubber
life-boat?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At considerable cost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, get me one if you can, and have it
put in,&rdquo; said Linda, as if she were ordering an
ice-cream soda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you really are serious about going?&rdquo;
asked the man, unable to believe she meant
what she was saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I find good reason to think that couple
sailed for Hawaii,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;But not if
I don&rsquo;t. It isn&rsquo;t a stunt, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls left immediately in a taxicab for
the dock. Here they saw numerous small boats
and yachts, and it occurred to Linda to wonder
whether the missing couple might not have
gone off in a pleasure boat. But after all, they
couldn&rsquo;t get far in the Pacific in a yacht, unless
it were one specially built for the purpose, and
the idea seemed improbable.</p>
<p>They made their inquiries about the couple
of a sailor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there were several young couples
among the passengers that left for Hawaii yesterday,&rdquo;
he informed them. &ldquo;About thirty
passengers, all told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But did one of the young couples look like
honeymooners?&rdquo; demanded Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say as I noticed. But you can look
at the list of passengers in the office. That
ought to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led the girls through an open door, where
they found the book on the desk with the name
of the boat, the &ldquo;Mona,&rdquo; and the list. But, as
they had expected, neither the name of Bower
nor of Sprague occurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that girl were using her own maiden
name, we shouldn&rsquo;t even know what it was,&rdquo;
remarked Dot, gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; admitted Linda, thinking how
strange it was that once again they were involved
in complications with a nameless girl.
But, unlike poor little Helen Tower, who had
been nameless because of a cruel accident
wherein she lost her memory, this girl was deliberately,
criminally, nameless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;Were there any couples in flying costumes?&rdquo;
asked Dot, thinking perhaps that if
the Spragues had hiked from the plane, and
speed were their object, they wouldn&rsquo;t have
had time to change.</p>
<p>But such a course would have been too obvious,
and would have given them away immediately.
As she expected, the sailor shook his
head to the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any with hand-luggage?&rdquo; suggested Linda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. A couple of couples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re getting there! Can you describe
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say as I could. Didn&rsquo;t look at &rsquo;em,
to tell you the truth. Only I do recollect our
baggage man sayin&rsquo; he was gipped out of two
tips, so these two guys must of carried their
bags theirselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go see him,&rdquo; suggested Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a Mexican. Don&rsquo;t speak English. But
maybe I can explain to him what you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked about the dock until they found
a greasy-looking man who was sprawled on a
truck-van, smoking a pipe. The sailor explained
what the girls wanted, and the man sat
up and stared at them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>Linda could hardly restrain a shudder. She
thought that she wouldn&rsquo;t care about meeting
this man alone in the dark, or in the desert.
But he seemed pleasant enough. And, to their
delight, he gave them the information they
wanted. Pointing abruptly at Linda, he told
the sailor in Mexican that one woman looked
like that girl!</p>
<p>Before the latter had even interpreted his
meaning, Linda and Dot had jumped to the correct
conclusion and were wild with excitement.
Nothing could keep them back now, short of a
cyclone. If the weather held like this on the
morrow, they would be on their way to Hawaii!</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles it!&rdquo; announced Linda. Then,
turning to the sailor, she inquired the exact
destination of the &ldquo;Mona.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honolulu,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll send a wireless there now,&rdquo; she
said, and proceeded to write out a message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold all passengers of the &lsquo;Mona&rsquo; for identification
at Honolulu dock. Two criminals
aboard.... Signed, Linda Carlton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Captain ought to pick up that message,
too,&rdquo; she remarked, turning to Dot as soon as
the words had been sent. &ldquo;And the thing for
us to do now, is to make sure that we beat that
boat to Honolulu!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>Realizing their need for rest and food, the
girls went back to their taxi and directed the
driver to take them to the best hotel the seaport
afforded. Here they engaged a room for
the night and proceeded to make themselves
comfortable. After they had their baths, they
stretched out on the bed in their room, shaded
and darkened by awnings from the hot sun,
and began to discuss the proposition seriously.
They realized now how suddenly they had
plunged headlong into what really might be the
experience of a lifetime&mdash;an undertaking that
took most fliers months and months to prepare
for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we ought to go, Dot?&rdquo; asked
Linda, over-awed for the first time at the dangers
of the project, when she considered them
for somebody besides herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dying to go!&rdquo; cried the other girl, her
eyes sparkling with anticipation. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
only one thing that might hold me back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? You mean consideration for
your parents?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. They&rsquo;d be willing to let me do anything
you considered safe. It&rsquo;s just that if I
didn&rsquo;t go with you, you could take a more experienced
flier in my place&mdash;or a mechanic or a
navigator. And that would be better and safer
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; laughed Linda. &ldquo;I can do
those things, and if anything goes wrong, you
can take the controls. You certainly fly well&mdash;I&rsquo;d
trust you a lot farther than a good many
boys I know&mdash;like Ralph Clavering, for instance.
You&rsquo;re air-minded&mdash;you have air sense,
to put it another way&mdash;and you never get
rattled. You can take charge if I want to rest&mdash;though
it isn&rsquo;t nearly so far as Paris, and I
flew that alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; agreed Dot. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t even
as far as if we were taking off from Los Angeles.&rdquo;
She was pleased, more than she could
say, at her chum&rsquo;s praise, for Linda Carlton
never said anything she didn&rsquo;t mean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;re a lot farther south than Los
Angeles&mdash;almost in a direct line westward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to tell your Aunt Emily?&rdquo;
inquired Dot, after a moment of silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I think not. I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ll tell
anybody except the people at this airport.
Then, if anything goes wrong, we shan&rsquo;t have
a lot of unpleasant publicity. Besides, it&rsquo;s all
the better for our cause to keep it a secret.
It&rsquo;s not an aviation feat this time, like flying the
Atlantic. The main object is to catch those
two criminals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we won&rsquo;t call Spring City on the telephone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Let&rsquo;s send wires, assuring our families
of our safety, and telling them not to expect us
home for several days. That will put their
minds at rest, and won&rsquo;t disclose anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about food?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough for a day. I figure that if we start
before dawn tomorrow, we ought to land early
in the morning of the following day. So, while
I am mapping out our course, you can go visit
the chef and see about packing sandwiches and
fruit and coffee. That ought to be enough.
And we&rsquo;ll eat an early breakfast before we
start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are the predictions for weather?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Favorable and warm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem possible that we&rsquo;re going
so soon,&rdquo; observed Dot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the way I like to do things,&rdquo; returned
Linda. &ldquo;With a snap&mdash;and we&rsquo;re off! Let&rsquo;s
have an early supper, about six o&rsquo;clock, and get
in bed by nine. And leave a call for three
o&rsquo;clock tomorrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three o&rsquo;clock! The time lots of young
people are getting home from dances!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is going to be more thrilling than
any dance you ever attended, Dot Crowley!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be the thrill of a lifetime!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it is. I really believe it will end
happily, or I shouldn&rsquo;t be taking you along, for
I am the one who&rsquo;s responsible. The Sky
Rocket can carry a good load, and we&rsquo;re both
so light that I can easily put in a big extra tank
of gas for emergency, in case we get off our
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if that runs out, or anything else happens,
we&rsquo;ll go to sea in a rubber life-boat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we shan&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; said Linda....
&ldquo;But now we really must get to work. I&rsquo;m
going to get out my maps. It&rsquo;ll be a pretty
hard job to locate those little islands in that
vast expanse of ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we only don&rsquo;t run into a fog!&rdquo; commented
Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if we do, there&rsquo;s the good old earth-inductor
compass to guide us. And besides,
our course lies pretty straight westward.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>For the next few hours the girls scarcely exchanged
a word, so busily were they employed
upon their duties. Dot sent the wires and interviewed
the chef of the hotel, and Linda
pored over maps and diagrams, running her
fingers through her hair, marking her course
with her pencil. At six o&rsquo;clock she telephoned
to the airport with final instructions. Then,
dressed as they were, for all their dresses were
still at the Los Angeles hotel, they went down
to dinner.</p>
<p>The dining-room was warm in spite of the
fans, and it seemed exactly like midsummer to
the girls, although it really was October by the
calendar. But San Lucas was much farther
south than Spring City, Ohio.</p>
<p>There were not many people in the dining-room,
for it was an early hour to dine. How
thankful the girls were that they were not at
the Ambassador, crowded as it always was with
motion-picture people and visitors! They ate
their meal slowly, then retired to their room to
work quietly until bed-time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>And so, at nine o&rsquo;clock they prepared to go
to sleep, conscious that their next night would
probably be spent on the ocean&mdash;an adventure
which would either end in disaster, or would
make a story that would go down in history, of
the first young women to fly the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Only time could answer that question!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">OVER THE PACIFIC</span></h2>
<p>The gray dawn of early morning found
Linda and Dot at the airport of Cape San
Lucas, all ready to take off on their momentous
journey. More than two thousand miles
over the biggest ocean in the world, without a
single stop!</p>
<p>The Sky Rocket was already on the runway,
in perfect condition for the trip. Her high-powered
Wright engine was performing as excellently
as an expensive watch; her instruments
were in tune, her tanks filled. The wireless
had been tested, and found to be working,
and the rubber life-boat which Linda had
ordered was tucked away in the plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are the weather predictions for this
morning?&rdquo; Linda inquired of the mechanic, as
Dot put the lunch into the cockpit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good for at least twenty-four hours,&rdquo; he
replied. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not the only danger, Miss
Carlton.&rdquo; He shook his head ominously. &ldquo;This
is sure suicide,&rdquo; he predicted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; demanded Dot. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the motor in
perfect condition? There isn&rsquo;t anything wrong,
is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. She&rsquo;s O.K. Oiled her up a bit, and
tightened a few screws. It isn&rsquo;t that. But you&rsquo;ll
run into a typhoon, or lose your way&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty straight course,&rdquo; said Linda.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on the Tropic of Cancer now, and
Hawaii is just a little below it. It looks like
pretty easy navigating to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome to it. And&mdash;happy
landing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda and Dot lost no time in getting started.
Five minutes later the Sky Rocket was triumphantly
rising into the air, heading straight
towards the ocean. Over the weeds and rough
seashore growth on the beach, past the waves
breaking on the shore of the Pacific! The sun
had not yet risen, but it was light enough to
see where they were going. On they flew; now
the waves seemed higher, but the air was calm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>There was little wind, so Linda continued to
fly low, so that they could make use of the
cushion of air on top of the water. And it was
thrilling to watch the ocean&mdash;more exciting
than seeing it from the deck of a boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem calmer than the Atlantic,&rdquo; observed
Dot, in a loud tone. Seated side by side
as they were in the companion cockpit, it was
not necessary to use the speaking-tube, and for
this advantage they were grateful. &ldquo;They say
that&rsquo;s why it was called the &lsquo;Pacific.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful, anyway,&rdquo; returned Linda,
admiringly.</p>
<p>On and on they flew, ever westward, as the
sun rose in its full glory behind them. Soon
the land was lost to view; there were no vessels
in sight&mdash;only limitless sky and ocean, and
two girls alone in that vast, empty universe.
But both girls were in high spirits; neither was
the least bit afraid.</p>
<p>Climbing a little higher, Linda opened her
throttle to its maximum, and found themselves
travelling at a speed of a hundred and fifty
miles an hour. The girls laughed and sang at
the joy of the exhilarating motion, but they did
not attempt to talk. There was so much to
think about&mdash;the fun of the flight, and the
triumph of landing in Hawaii, ahead of that
boat, the &ldquo;Mona.&rdquo; Oh, if they only made it!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>Water everywhere&mdash;and the sky overhead.
Noontime came, with the sun right above them,
and the girls realized that it had been a long
time since they had eaten. Dot made a dive for
the coffee and sandwiches, divided off as they
were in portions for lunch and supper and
breakfast, and both girls ate ravenously. When
they had finished she insisted that Linda take
a rest.</p>
<p>With a yawn and a stretch, Linda willingly
complied, and gave the controls over to the
other girl. It would afford her not only an
opportunity to relax, but a chance to study the
maps as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve covered eight hundred miles already,&rdquo;
she shouted in Dot&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;re
sticking straight to our course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the gas holding out?&rdquo; returned her
companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine. I think we&rsquo;ll have some left over, at
this rate.... Now Dot, if you&rsquo;re all right, I
think I&rsquo;ll take forty winks. Even that blazing
sun doesn&rsquo;t seem to keep me from being
sleepy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>The other girl nodded, and Linda slipped off
to sleep. Even the bumps in the air seemed to
have no effect upon her slumbers; for an hour
perhaps, she slept soundly, while Dot continued
on the flight. Then, all of a sudden she was
abruptly awakened by a terrified cry from her
companion. The plane was dropping&mdash;it seemed
to be diving right into the ocean&mdash;into the very
jaws of death!</p>
<p>For one brief moment Linda thought of the
life-boat, but that did not seem feasible now. Instinctively
she grabbed the stick, and pulled it
back sharply. The Sky Rocket wobbled almost
on the surface of the water, and at that very
moment a hideous, terrifying shark poked its
head above the surface!</p>
<p>For one awful second death stared them in
the face. Not the easy death of drowning, but
a horrible torturing agony at the jaws of a
ferocious fish. The plane seemed to hover uncertainly
for a moment; then with a sudden
lightning speed it gathered control and started
to climb upward&mdash;to safety!</p>
<p>Linda let out a gasp of relief, and Dot sobbed
in contrition as the Sky Rocket soared into the
air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I could have done it,&rdquo;
wailed Dot. &ldquo;All of a sudden, it seemed as if
we were headed straight for the ocean, and
nothing could stop us. If you hadn&rsquo;t taken hold
that very instant, we&rsquo;d have been killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a lucky escape,&rdquo; returned Linda.
&ldquo;And from now on we&rsquo;ll make it a point to fly
higher, even if we can&rsquo;t use the wind to such
advantage, as we could right over the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The afternoon passed, with the motor still
functioning perfectly. The wind increased
somewhat, but not enough to disturb Linda
greatly. She was continuing to fly high, for she
didn&rsquo;t want to run any risk of hitting that deep,
terrifying ocean again. A little before sunset
they sighted a ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going a little lower,&rdquo; she shouted to
Dot. &ldquo;Get your glasses. We&rsquo;ll see whether
that&rsquo;s the &lsquo;Mona.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is!&rdquo; exclaimed Dot, a few minutes later.
&ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;re too far south to meet the
regular Los Angeles-Hawaii lines. But we must
be following about the same course as the
&lsquo;Mona.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep a watch-out for the girl-friend!&rdquo; advised
Linda.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>Down they glided, keeping the ship in sight
until they were about a hundred feet over the
water. It was a small boat&mdash;not nearly so large
as the regular San Francisco-Hawaii line; and
they could see the people hurrying to the deck,
peering through their glasses, and waving and
shouting in greeting. Dot, too, did her share
of the searching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see them,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Linda looked intently, but she could not distinguish
the passengers&rsquo; faces. However, she
did not think it was likely that Sprague or his
wife would be waving to them. They would
surely recognize the plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably they&rsquo;ve been keeping off the
decks,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Hiding, as much as possible,
without arousing suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the girl&rsquo;s seasick,&rdquo; observed Dot. &ldquo;I
only hope she doesn&rsquo;t pass out and get buried
at sea, before we ever have a look at her, or a
chance to collect that five thousand,&rdquo; remarked
Dot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>Linda regained her height, and sped onward,
determined to get to Hawaii well in advance of
the boat, and to lie in wait for the criminals.
The blood was rushing through her veins, and
she was thrilled with the chase, but she resolutely
kept calm. The worst of the trip&mdash;the
black night&mdash;was ahead of her, and she needed
every ounce she had of energy and nerve.</p>
<p>The plane was still doing well over a hundred
miles an hour, and going forward with mighty
gains, eating up the miles. The sun set and
once again the girls ate some sandwiches and
drank more coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost afraid to offer to take the controls
and let you rest,&rdquo; said Dot, humbly.
&ldquo;After the way I fell down before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the Sky Rocket that did the falling,&rdquo;
laughed Linda. &ldquo;But I guess that wouldn&rsquo;t
happen again. You&rsquo;ll stay up high, I&rsquo;m
thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll trust me again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Dot. Don&rsquo;t be so foolish. Besides,
I want to do a little calculating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Relaxing back in her seat, Linda consulted
her maps and her sextant, when suddenly she
heard a queer noise. The motor was knocking
in a strange, ominous way that almost made the
girls&rsquo; hearts stop beating. Was it going dead?
Panic-stricken, Dot looked down on the ocean,
hoping that she could see the &ldquo;Mona,&rdquo; or some
other ship that might rescue them, and Linda&rsquo;s
thoughts turned to the wireless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>The tapping was growing worse; the engine
seemed to be dying. Linda racked her brain
for a reason; surely the gas hadn&rsquo;t given out.
Telling Dot to keep on guiding the plane, she
examined the feed-valve. And here she located
the trouble!</p>
<p>A broad smile of relief spread over her face.
&ldquo;I can fix that, easily,&rdquo; she assured her companion.
&ldquo;Just hang on for a couple of
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was as good as her word; soon the knocking
ceased, and the engine was running as
smoothly as when the Sky Rocket left Cape San
Lucas. And Linda herself was back at the controls,
urging Dot to avail herself of a nap while
she had the chance.</p>
<p>It was entirely dark now, and the stars were
shining in the sky, and reflected in the ocean,
making a beautiful picture for the girls as they
flew on. Phosphorescent lights, too, played
through the water, reminding Linda of the
dangerous life beneath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>Towards ten o&rsquo;clock, while Dot was taking
her nap, they had one more terrifying experience.
Suddenly, for no reason at all, they
started to fall. Yet the engine was not dead,
nor was their motion slow enough for a stall.
There was only one explanation, of course: an
air-pocket. Down, down they came, like an elevator
whose cords have been broken. Dot
wakened up with a scream and the beads of
perspiration stood out on Linda&rsquo;s forehead, for
she believed that this time the sea was really
about to swallow them.</p>
<p>But she had been flying high, and this proved
to be her salvation. She tried banking the plane,
first on one side and then on the other, breaking
the fall, but making both herself and Dot
dizzy with the sickening motion. Her head
swam; she hardly knew what she was doing,
and there was the black water beneath them.
But at last a current of air swept under the
wings, assuring her that she was out of danger
once more. Making a sharp turn away from
the air-pocket, she found her plane responding
to the stick as she started to climb back again
to the height she had lost.</p>
<p>The girls breathed freely again, and Dot, now
wide awake, produced coffee from the thermos
bottle, for they felt in need of a stimulant. But,
as the plane flew fearlessly on, and the flight
again became monotonous, Dot fell asleep once
more, and Linda continued, waking and
watchful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>She watched the stars fade gradually from
the sky, and the first gray light play over the
sea. Tensely alert, she glanced eagerly at her
speedometer. If her calculations were correct,
there were only three hundred miles more to
go!</p>
<p>It was considerably lighter when Dot finally
opened her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine companion I am!&rdquo; she exclaimed, in
shame. &ldquo;To go to sleep like that. Leaving you
as lonely as you were on your Atlantic flight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda reached over and touched her hand
affectionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it, Dot!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It
makes a big difference, having you here....
And if you&rsquo;re awake now, I&rsquo;d like to have you
take control. I want to do some figuring. Now
that we&rsquo;re getting so near, I want to locate the
islands. Suppose we&rsquo;d miss them, after coming
all this distance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we would!&rdquo; repeated Dot. &ldquo;And
never realize it till we landed on the coast of
Australia!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d know it before then. Our gas would
give out somewhere in the middle of the ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re not going to miss them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was, as Linda said, one of the most difficult
parts of the flight, to locate those tiny dots of
islands in the vast expanse of ocean. But Linda
was a good navigator, and she made her calculations
correctly. They were, she discovered,
only about fifty miles off their course&mdash;an error
which was easily remedied, since their gas
supply was adequate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred miles more!&rdquo; she announced,
when she finally resumed control. &ldquo;Now we can
watch for the sea-gulls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nearer and nearer to their destination they
came. Now Dot spied some fishing craft with
her glasses, and that fact told her that the shore
must be near. Her excitement was so intense
that she could hardly sit still. The end of her
first ocean flight! Her first landing from over
the water!</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re coming!&rdquo; she shouted, in wild
exultation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>Linda was almost equally thrilled, although
her pulse was calmer. It had been less terrifying,
less difficult, less nerve-racking than the
solitary, long flight over the Atlantic. But she
was nevertheless excited.</p>
<p>Now the cliffs rose from the ocean, and the
waves broke against the shore, showing their
white-caps. And, as if to stage a dramatic
arrival, the sun rose in all its glory, shedding
its beams over the land and water.</p>
<p>The green island of Molokai was beneath
them!</p>
<p>But this was not their destination, and Linda
pressed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to land?&rdquo; cried Dot, in
disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Linda. &ldquo;We are making for
the island of Oahu. I must come down in
Honolulu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On they flew, past Molokai, directing their
course southwest, over the indigo waters of the
Pacific, now so beautiful in the sunlight, then
swinging north towards the capital city of the
Hawaiian Islands. Now they saw speed boats
and launches on the waves; they passed the
great Diamond Head, and Waikiki beach, and
hovered at last over the Rogers Airport on the
coast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>&ldquo;Honolulu!&rdquo; cried Linda, joyously. &ldquo;We are
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the girls looked beneath them, it seemed
for a moment as if the airport were a bed of
flowers. Garlands of leis and gardenias filled
the air with a strange and wonderful fragrance.
Then, as Linda dropped lower, she realized that
these flowers were all in the arms of people
standing about the ground. People of every
race and color.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are all those people?&rdquo; demanded Dot.
&ldquo;Do you suppose there&rsquo;s been an accident?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope not!&rdquo; replied Linda. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep
on flying over the field until they scatter. I
mustn&rsquo;t hurt anybody.&rdquo; She brought the Sky
Rocket lower, and gave a signal that she wanted
to land.</p>
<p>But already policemen were busily pushing
the crowd back, making a clear runway for the
plane. When Linda thought it was safe, she
gracefully glided to the ground.</p>
<p>Even above the noise of the engine, the girls
heard the wild shouts of the multitude.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Linda Carlton! Hello, Dot Crowley!&rdquo;
seemed to rise from every direction, and flowers
were strewn in their path. &ldquo;Welcome to
Oahu!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls stared at each other a moment in
consternation, not understanding how these
people could possibly be informed of their
names. But only a moment, for the crowd
rushed in, and it took all the policemen&rsquo;s efforts
to hold them in check. A small and select group
of half a dozen or so were admitted close to the
plane.</p>
<p>From this group, a couple of young fliers
stepped forward and lifted the girls right out
of the cockpit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations to the first girls to cross
the Pacific!&rdquo; they cried, as they put garlands
of leis around their necks. Then, with Linda
and Dot on their shoulders, high over the heads
of the crowd, the boys carried them to a waiting
car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aloha!&rdquo; shouted everyone as they passed.
&ldquo;To our heroines of the air!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">THE ISLAND OF OAHU</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you know about us?&rdquo; gasped
Dot, as she found herself miraculously seated
in a shining, low car at the edge of the flying
field. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t tell anybody about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both the young men grinned broadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A special late edition came out last night
with the announcement,&rdquo; explained one of the
boys. &ldquo;A Los Angeles paper. And every newspaper
in the United States and Hawaii will run
the story this morning. Besides, a ship you
flew over yesterday sent a radio that you had
been sighted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car moved slowly through the space
blocked off by the policemen, and Linda and
Dot smiled and waved to the crowd as they
passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we going now?&rdquo; asked Linda.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>&ldquo;To the Governor&rsquo;s mansion. There&rsquo;s a big
breakfast waiting for you. Then there will be
a reception tonight. Did you know that you
will receive an award of ten thousand dollars,
to be shared between you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda and Dot looked at each other in amazement.
They had undertaken the flight with no
thought of glory or reward, and they were winning
applause from the whole world. It was
nothing short of miraculous!</p>
<p>But what would their own relatives think?
Miss Carlton, and Mr. and Mrs. Crowley&mdash;and
Linda&rsquo;s father, who hadn&rsquo;t even been informed
of the project? Was it too late now to send
them telegrams?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We each get five thousand dollars?&rdquo; repeated
Dot, incredulously. &ldquo;But why? Who is
giving it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wealthy woman in Honolulu promised
that amount some time ago to the first woman
to fly to Hawaii from the coast of America. The
only point she stipulated was that there was to
be no man in the plane. So, if two girls made
the flight, she said she would divide the prize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ll get the five thousand back that
you lost, Linda!&rdquo; exclaimed Dot. &ldquo;Now you
won&rsquo;t have to catch that girl.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m going to catch her,&rdquo; Linda insisted.
&ldquo;Not for the money, especially, but because
I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The automobile threaded its way through the
streets of Honolulu, on to the Governor&rsquo;s mansion.
Here the girls were received with the
greatest cordiality by the chief executive&rsquo;s
wife. A lovely breakfast, to which all the important
aviators of the island were invited, was
served on the wide veranda, and a suite of
rooms had been set aside for the girls&rsquo; visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you will want to take a nap first,&rdquo;
said their charming hostess. &ldquo;Then, after you
have rested, perhaps you would like to go down
to our beach and bathe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d love it!&rdquo; cried Dot, eagerly. &ldquo;Think
of the thrill of going in bathing in October!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then this evening,&rdquo; continued the older
woman, &ldquo;is the banquet, followed by a reception
in your honor at the hotel. And Mrs. Dinwitty,
the donor of the award, will present you
with your checks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all just too wonderful!&rdquo; exclaimed Dot.
&ldquo;But what shall we do for clothes? We can&rsquo;t
attend receptions in flying-suits!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that they are provided,&rdquo; promised
the other. &ldquo;We have marvellous shops in our
city, and now that I know your sizes, it will be
easy enough to order a supply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as she had left them, Linda went to
the telephone in her room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must call the police before we go to
sleep,&rdquo; she said to Dot. &ldquo;We might miss our
criminals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reply, however, was reassuring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Mona&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t dock till noon tomorrow,&rdquo;
an official assured her. &ldquo;And we have
detailed men to help you. We got in touch with
the Los Angeles police after we got your wireless,
and we made out a warrant for the arrest
of the girl. We&rsquo;ll call you when the ship docks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reassured now, and at ease for the rest of
the day, the girls slept all morning in the beautiful
bedroom set aside for their visit, and after
luncheon they were driven to the famous Waikiki
beach, and lay on the sand and later rode
the waves of the Pacific on the long, narrow
boards which they had so often seen pictured
in the movies. There was so much to do and
see and enjoy that they wished that they might
spend at least a month in this Paradise of the
Pacific, as the Hawaiian Islands are so often
called.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to think of crime and criminals in
a spot like this,&rdquo; remarked Linda, as she lay on
the sand and gazed at the deep blue sky above
her. &ldquo;I purposely haven&rsquo;t mentioned them to
our hostess&mdash;because I didn&rsquo;t want to spoil
things. Today has been so perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And perfect it continued to be, until the girls
finally closed their eyes in sleep that night. The
dinner and the reception were gorgeous affairs,
yet the kindness of the Governor and his wife
prevented them from becoming stilted and formal.
Even Linda felt no embarrassment when
she was called out and presented with the
check. For Dot was at her side, equal to the
occasion with a clever little speech of acceptance
and thanks.</p>
<p>Excitement had kept the girls going during
the first day, but the next morning reaction set
in and they felt as if they wanted to sleep forever.
Their thoughtful hostess, realizing just
what they had been through, decided not to
have them wakened. Telegrams and flowers began
to arrive, but she saw no need of disturbing
Linda and Dot. She did not know that they
were counting on meeting the ship that was
scheduled to dock at noon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>At last, however, Linda opened her eyes and
reached for her wrist-watch that lay on the
tiny table between her bed and Dot&rsquo;s. It said
twenty minutes after twelve!</p>
<p>She picked it up and examined it closely,
unable to believe her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dot!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve overslept! Do you
suppose the police have called? And we&rsquo;ve
missed them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Missed&mdash;who&mdash;whom&mdash;I mean?&rdquo; inquired
her companion, sleepily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The couple we&rsquo;re after! Sprague and that
girl! Oh, Dot, wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; asked Dot, realizing at
last the seriousness of the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get dressed at once!&rdquo; replied Linda, as she
rang the bell for the maid.</p>
<p>Almost miraculously the latter appeared in
answer to the summons, with fresh sports-clothing
for both the girls. And bringing telegrams
and boxes of flowers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have the police telephoned?&rdquo; asked Linda,
to the maid&rsquo;s amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Police? Oh, no, ma&rsquo;am. There&rsquo;s been some
calls for you, but not from the police. Are you
expectin&rsquo; them?&rdquo; She eyed the girls suspiciously,
as if she thought they might be criminals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Linda, her fingers already on
the telephone, giving the number to the
operator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Linda Carlton,&rdquo; she announced.
&ldquo;Has the &lsquo;Mona&rsquo; docked yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am. But she&rsquo;s due any minute now,
and the Chief gave me orders to call you. We&rsquo;ve
got a warrant ready for Mrs. Leslie Sprague&mdash;is
that right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; replied Linda, grinning with
satisfaction. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll be right over&mdash;so hold
all the passengers until we get a look at them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K., Miss Carlton. See you later!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda replaced the receiver, and turned to
the maid, who was still awaiting her orders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we could have our breakfast
right away&mdash;and then have a car take us to the
flying field?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Please ask your
mistress&mdash;and tell her that it&rsquo;s terribly important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you even going to read those telegrams?&rdquo;
inquired Dot, a trifle disappointed.
After all, it was her first big air triumph, and
she wanted to enjoy the victory to its utmost.
But, instead, Linda must be rushing off immediately.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>&ldquo;When we come back!&rdquo; returned the latter,
as she put on the pretty white linen suit with
which her hostess had provided her.</p>
<p>Dot sighed, and proceeded to dress. There
was no stopping Linda, once she had made up
her mind to do something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could go alone, Dot,&rdquo; Linda remarked, as
they started for the dining-room. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d
have a chance to enjoy yourself this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied her chum. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t going to
take long, and I wouldn&rsquo;t miss it for the world.
You know how I despise that man Sprague&mdash;I
want to gloat over his capture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They ate a hasty meal that was both breakfast
and lunch, and got into a car with a native
chauffeur, that was waiting for them in the
driveway. A few minutes later they arrived at
the dock, just as the passengers from the
&ldquo;Mona&rdquo; were about to be discharged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>It would have been difficult to press through
the crowds of native children, with their
flowers of welcome for the arriving visitors,
had the girls not had the aid of the Chief of
Police. Clearing a passage for himself and his
companions, he led them right on board the
&ldquo;Mona.&rdquo; The Captain came forward to meet
them, beaming proudly at the two brave aviatrixes,
as he shook their hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations, Miss Carlton and Miss
Crowley!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You did a valiant
thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you so much,&rdquo; replied Linda,
modestly. She had no desire to talk of her
flight over the Pacific; her one absorbing interest
now was the capture of the girl whom she
had pursued so far.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand here,&rdquo; continued the Captain, &ldquo;and
you can watch the passengers as they go by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two by two the people on board the &ldquo;Mona&rdquo;
walked over the gangplank to the pier, as Linda
and Dot, their hearts beating fast with excitement,
peered intently into their faces.</p>
<p>A dozen couples hurried by, then three lone
passengers straggled along as if in no haste at
all. But still no girl that even remotely resembled
Linda. And no sign of Leslie Sprague.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is&mdash;that&mdash;all?&rdquo; faltered Linda, unable to
believe that they really had not come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s one more couple. They&rsquo;re still awful
seasick,&rdquo; explained the Captain, and Linda and
Dot strained their necks to catch the first
glimpse of these last people, just emerging
from the cabin.</p>
<p>But their hopes were immediately dashed to
the ground. The couple were elderly; their
hair gray, their faces wrinkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s a disguise,&rdquo; whispered Dot,
suspiciously.</p>
<p>The Captain shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I know these people well. Cousins of
mine, by the name of Rankin. Lived on Oahu
all their lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda heaved a deep sigh of disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re sure that&rsquo;s positively all the
passengers who sailed from Cape San Lucas?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All except a couple that docked at the island
of Lanai. A planter who lives there part of
every year&mdash;and often makes the trip. I know
him well&mdash;have brought him across half a
dozen times. He had a new bride with him this
trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A new bride!&rdquo; repeated Linda. &ldquo;Did she
look like me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain regarded her closely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>&ldquo;Believe she did.... But that man&rsquo;s not a
criminal. He couldn&rsquo;t be the fellow you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, whether the man is or not, the girl
is!&rdquo; cried Linda. &ldquo;What name did they give?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steve Long is the man&rsquo;s name. He didn&rsquo;t
have to give it&mdash;I know him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light hair&mdash;light moustache?&rdquo; she questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sissy-looking!&rdquo; added Dot.</p>
<p>The Captain smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be your man,&rdquo; he agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we have to fly to Lanai,&rdquo; muttered
Linda, turning to the Chief of Police. &ldquo;Can you
help me out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean go with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not necessarily. I&rsquo;d rather not overload
the plane.... Isn&rsquo;t there somebody on the
island who would help us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course there is. I can send a wireless to
our agent over there, and you can report to
him. He can give you native police, if you need
them. And give you the warrant for the
girl&rsquo;s arrest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>They completed their arrangements, and had
the chauffeur drive them immediately to the
airport, where the Sky Rocket had been resting
since their landing the preceding morning.
Here they dismissed the car, asking the driver
to make their explanations to his mistress,
assuring her that they would be back in time for
dinner. Linda then went in search of her
plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of shape is she in?&rdquo; she asked,
as she spied the Sky Rocket in a hangar, with a
mechanic beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; replied the man. &ldquo;We did some
overhauling on her yesterday&mdash;a few minor repairs,
and filled her up with gas and oil. She&rsquo;s
fit as a fiddle now.... But why? You girls
aren&rsquo;t thinking of flying back over the ocean,
are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; laughed Linda. &ldquo;Once is enough. But
we want to go to one of the islands&mdash;Lanai, to
be exact&mdash;to do some scouting. We&rsquo;re after a
criminal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A criminal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two criminals, rather. Forgers&mdash;thieves.
They came across on the &lsquo;Mona,&rsquo; and we
thought they&rsquo;d dock here&mdash;but they got off at
Lanai instead.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>&ldquo;By heck!&rdquo; exclaimed the mechanic in
amazement. &ldquo;What will modern girls take up
next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell us what that island is like?&rdquo;
asked Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not like Oahu,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Not
a place that tourists visit much. No hotels and
stores&mdash;or cities. Mostly pineapple plantations
there&mdash;not many white people, except some of
the owners.... But I&rsquo;ll get you a map, and
show you just where to land if you want to go
to the agent&rsquo;s office first. He can tell you all
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He disappeared into an office, and returned
with the map in question, marking the best spot
on the beach for Linda to make her landing.
Then he had the Sky Rocket pushed out on the
runway, and the engine started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch the planes that arrive and leave
here,&rdquo; Linda shouted into his ear as she
climbed into the cockpit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be on the job!&rdquo; the man assured her.
&ldquo;And happy landings to you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>The Sky Rocket taxied along the runway, and
left the ground a minute later, as if it, too, were
eager to be in the skies again, on the chase.
Over the beach of Waikiki, past Diamond Head,
southeast over the Pacific Ocean again, Linda
directed her course, sure that at last she was
within sight of her goal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">MISSING!</span></h2>
<p>The girls had been away from Spring City
for ten days when Mr. Carlton, Linda&rsquo;s father,
returned from his trip abroad and arrived at
his sister&rsquo;s home, expecting, naturally, to see
his daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Emily!&rdquo; he exclaimed, walking in as
he so often did, without any notice, and kissing
his sister nonchalantly, as if he had been absent
a week instead of six months. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
Linda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hollywood,&rdquo; was his sister&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; exclaimed the man, in a tone of deepest
disappointment. It had always been a
matter of extreme satisfaction to him that
Linda had never been carried away by the lure
of fame and fortune, and accepted a motion-picture
contract.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so horrified, Tom!&rdquo; laughed Miss
Carlton. &ldquo;I only wish she were safely acting
for the movies. Instead of that, she&rsquo;s chasing
wildly around Mexico after a couple of
criminals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mexico!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And I&rsquo;m so afraid of bandits there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Emily, you&rsquo;re judging Mexico by the
movies. That sort of stuff has gone out long
ago. Mexico City is as civilized as New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mexico City&mdash;yes. But that isn&rsquo;t where
Linda&rsquo;s telegram is from, and that isn&rsquo;t where
she&rsquo;ll be. Trust her to find some lonely wilderness!
Oh, I&rsquo;m so worried. In fact, I&rsquo;m packing
now to go out to Los Angeles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her brother sat down and lighted a cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might as well tell me the story,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Miss Carlton made it as brief as possible and
showed her brother the telegrams she had received
thus far. The man listened quietly, more
worried than he cared to admit to his sister,
but then and there he decided to go with her.</p>
<p>He would have preferred to fly by the commercial
air-line, in order to save time, but since
Miss Carlton stubbornly refused to get into a
plane, he agreed to take the fast train on which
she had already engaged passage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>A few hours later, just as they were about to
leave the house, a very excited young man
rushed into the living-room, without even waiting
to ring the doorbell. It was Ralph Clavering,
who always had the right to come and go as
he pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just heard the news about Linda and
Dot!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;And so Jim Valier and
I are flying to the coast in my autogiro immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What news?&rdquo; demanded Miss Carlton,
turning pale. Did he know more than she did&mdash;and
had something terrible happened to her
darling niece?</p>
<p>&ldquo;About chasing off to Mexico. Dot&rsquo;s mother
showed me the telegrams. Believe me, I&rsquo;m
scared this time. Those girls may be dead by
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&mdash;now&mdash;Ralph, please be a little more
tactful!&rdquo; urged Mr. Carlton. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t scare my
sister to death with your gloomy conjectures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared to death myself,&rdquo; muttered the
boy, sullenly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m going. There&rsquo;s
nobody out there to help her&mdash;not even Ted
Mackay, or that young reporter that saved her
from burning to death. I&rsquo;ve got to go!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, that&rsquo;s fine of you,&rdquo; agreed Mr.
Carlton. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t get all worked up about
it. I&rsquo;m betting on Linda and Dot every time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about your college work?&rdquo; questioned
Miss Carlton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be annoyed with classes when my
best girl&rsquo;s in danger,&rdquo; replied Ralph. &ldquo;And
Jim feels the same way about Dot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just ready to go too,&rdquo; announced
Miss Carlton. &ldquo;But not by plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph smiled; he did not need to be told that.</p>
<p>And so that morning in early October four
people departed from Spring City to go to the
rescue of those two daring young fliers, who
never expected help from anyone.</p>
<p>When the news came that Linda and Dot had
safely reached Honolulu, Ralph and Jim had
already arrived at the Los Angeles airport, and
Miss Carlton and her brother were well on their
way to the West.</p>
<p>Their train had stopped at Santa Fe for a
few moments, and newsboys were shouting the
story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two girls fly the Pacific!&rdquo; they screamed.
&ldquo;All about the flight to Hawaii!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Carlton looked at his sister.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;Could it be Linda and Dot?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>Miss Carlton nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. They would. I knew it. The
Pacific Ocean would be too much of a temptation
to Linda, once she was out here. I&rsquo;ve been
fearing it all along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t have to fear it any longer&mdash;if
it really is they who did it. It&rsquo;ll be over by
now&mdash;and the danger past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped to the platform and bought a
paper. And, sure enough, his daughter&rsquo;s and
Dot&rsquo;s pictures stared at him from the front
page.</p>
<p>There was no hiding his pride now. His eyes
shone with happiness; he looked like a small
boy who sees his favorite pitcher win a baseball
game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! Look! Emily!&rdquo; he cried, as he came
back to her chair. &ldquo;Read what it says for yourself!&rdquo;
And she noticed that his hands were
actually shaking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>A wave of pride and admiration surged over
Miss Carlton as she read about the two dauntless
girls. The first of their sex to make this
flight over the gigantic ocean&mdash;from the United
States to Hawaii. They had evidently made up
their minds in a hurry, and had not told anyone
except the people at the airport from which
they took off.</p>
<p>But the feat had evidently not been accepted
so casually by others, for already, they read,
the girls were being feted. Entertained by the
Governor of Hawaii&mdash;a reception planned in
their honor&mdash;and five thousand dollars apiece
to be presented to them!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think we came out to rescue them!&rdquo;
laughed Miss Carlton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what Ralph and Jim will think of
this news,&rdquo; remarked her brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ralph will probably be jealous because he
didn&rsquo;t make the flight with Linda&mdash;instead of
Dot. But Jim will just be filled with admiration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like Jim,&rdquo; observed Mr. Carlton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so does everybody,&rdquo; agreed his sister.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s so good-natured, even if he is lazy. But
he&rsquo;s really true-blue, all the way through. And
if Dot marries him, she&rsquo;ll certainly keep him
stepping.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you still want Linda to marry Ralph,
Emily?&rdquo; inquired the other. &ldquo;I remember
how excited you were at her graduation, because
he had evidently fallen so hard for her.
With all his wealth and social position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman smiled a little and shook her
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned my lesson, Tom,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;in
this year and a half since Linda&rsquo;s been out of
school. I had expected her to have a year of
parties&mdash;to &lsquo;come out,&rsquo; you know&mdash;and then
marry some nice young man. But Linda has
plans of her own, and I realize now that I might
as well save my time as to try to arrange anything
for her.... And, as for wealth and
social position&mdash;well, they simply mean nothing
in her life. Besides, she doesn&rsquo;t need them; I
can see that. Linda could go anywhere, be
accepted at Court, if she wanted to, because of
what she has accomplished herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve got so much sense, Emily!
Lots of women of your age wouldn&rsquo;t see that
at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t at first. But I do now. And so I
think, when she marries, it must be somebody
as big as herself. It won&rsquo;t be Ralph Clavering&mdash;unless
he does cave-man stuff, and actually
kidnaps her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>&ldquo;Even then, she&rsquo;d probably find a way to escape.
She always does get out of the most
difficult situations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. When Linda marries, I think it will
be love at first sight&mdash;on the spur of the moment,
just as she evidently decided to take this
flight to Hawaii. It will seem to her to be the
one, the only thing to do&mdash;and she&rsquo;ll do it. I&rsquo;m
sorry, for I&rsquo;d love a big wedding for her&mdash;she&rsquo;d
make such a beautiful bride&mdash;but I&rsquo;m not going
to count on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Carlton nodded approvingly. Like most
men, he couldn&rsquo;t see the use of the big fuss a
formal wedding entailed. But though he knew
Linda was tremendously interested in aviation,
he didn&rsquo;t want her to miss the happiness that
marriage would bring her. His own had been
blissfully happy during its short duration, until
his wife died at her baby daughter&rsquo;s birth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Linda will decide for herself,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;I only hope that the man will be
worthy of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t be. No mere man could possibly
equal Linda,&rdquo; remarked Miss Carlton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you love to tease, Emily!&rdquo; retorted
her brother. &ldquo;But I guess you&rsquo;re right at
that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>The rest of the journey seemed longer than
ever, now, to the impatient couple who longed
to be with the girls to celebrate their great triumph
with them. Never did a train seem to
move so slowly. But at last it arrived at Los
Angeles, about seven o&rsquo;clock of the night on
which Linda and Dot came down in the wilds of
Oahu, at the cabin of their enemies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take a boat to Honolulu tomorrow,&rdquo;
announced Miss Carlton. &ldquo;I only wish we
could take it right away&mdash;if there were only
one sailing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From out of the crowd on the platform two
young men, hatless and sun-burned, edged their
way toward the Carltons. Both were tall, so
that they could easily be seen above the heads
of the other people around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greetings, Miss Carlton!&rdquo; called Ralph
Clavering, before he had even reached them.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got bad news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad news!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Carlton, in consternation.
&ldquo;But we read in the papers that
the girls arrived safely in Honolulu!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. They did, sir. But they&rsquo;re lost again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Carlton seized Ralph&rsquo;s arm, to steady
herself, and looked into his face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not joking, Ralph? You wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;joke
about a thing like this?&rdquo; Her voice was
trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I&rsquo;m not, Miss Carlton,&rdquo; replied the
boy, earnestly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Carlton, however, looked less troubled
than his sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I know you&rsquo;re not joking, Ralph,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;But you probably are exaggerating.
You always see the black side of everything.
You and my sister are just alike.... But let&rsquo;s
go over here and sit down, and suppose Jim
tells us the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went to one of the waiting-rooms in the
station and sat down together, Miss Carlton
struggling hard to get herself under control.
Suppose Linda had taken it into her head to
fly back&mdash;and she and Dot were now lost at the
bottom of the Pacific! Suppose&mdash;But Jim was
already explaining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we don&rsquo;t know much that you haven&rsquo;t
read in the papers,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;The girls
went to the dinner and the reception in their
honor last night, and were staying at the Governor&rsquo;s
mansion. We were going to sail for the
island this morning, but there was no boat till
tomorrow, so we called them on the telephone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>&ldquo;That was about eleven o&rsquo;clock this morning,
and we were told that they were still asleep.
We phoned again at one, and they had gone out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we sent a couple of telegrams and
waited. We asked them to call our hotel here
at Los Angeles. But by seven o&rsquo;clock there
was no message, and we sort of got mad. At
least, Ralph did. I thought maybe they had too
much to do, but Ralph thought some new bird
like that Englishman Linda fell for last summer
was taking her time, and he resented it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I persuaded him to give them another
chance, and we phoned again. This time the
Governor himself talked to me. And he was
really scared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems Linda and Dot had gone to the airport
right after they got up about noon, and
had taken the Sky Rocket for a flight&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sky Rocket?&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Carlton.
&ldquo;Has Linda a new plane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Temporarily&mdash;yes. The Ladybug is here
at Los Angeles.... But that&rsquo;s another story.... Well,
anyhow, the girls promised to be back
early, for a dinner that had been planned in
their honor but they haven&rsquo;t been heard from!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>&ldquo;Murdered! Attacked by some half-breeds,
of course!&rdquo; cried Miss Carlton. &ldquo;And no man
with them to protect them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Emily!&rdquo; returned her brother.
&ldquo;They probably ran out of gas&mdash;or damaged a
wing. Or had a missing spark-plug. Linda will
fix that, and those two girls will show up tomorrow
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could think that, sir,&rdquo; said Ralph.
&ldquo;Gosh, if I only had my bug over there on that
island! But I haven&rsquo;t the nerve to fly it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; pleaded Miss Carlton. &ldquo;It
would only add another disaster to our troubles.
No, we&rsquo;ll sail together tomorrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meanwhile, let&rsquo;s go to our hotel and
wash and have dinner,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Carlton.
&ldquo;Then things may look brighter. I positively
refuse to worry till I have just cause!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wise man!&rdquo; commented Jim Valier, as he
picked up Miss Carlton&rsquo;s bag.</p>
<p>So the little group had dinner together at
the Ambassador, waiting all the time tensely
for news. But none came. And the newspapers
duly reported the story that the dinner for two
famous aviatrixes had been postponed!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">CAPTURE</span></h2>
<p>The flight across the Pacific from Oahu to
Lanai took less than two hours. Early in the
afternoon Linda brought the Sky Rocket to a
landing on the beach of the lonely island, near
to the spot indicated on her map.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be the agent&rsquo;s shack over there,&rdquo;
she said, as she and Dot climbed out of the
cockpit. &ldquo;I hope he&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls walked along the beach a short distance.
How different it was from Waikiki!
How deserted! Yet just as beautiful in the
bright sunlight. Before they reached the shack,
however, a man in a linen suit came out to meet
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Carlton and Miss Crowley, I suppose?&rdquo;
he inquired, holding out his hand. He
was a pleasant-faced man of middle age, with
a tanned complexion and eyes as blue as the
waters of the Pacific. &ldquo;My name is Jardin. I
have the wireless from Honolulu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you know all about us,&rdquo; said Linda.
&ldquo;Can you take us to Steven Long&rsquo;s plantation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can. But it doesn&rsquo;t seem possible
that that man is a criminal. What are the
charges against him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Briefly, Linda told the facts of her story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But those are all charges against the girl,&rdquo;
Jardin pointed out. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t anything
against Long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He stole two planes,&rdquo; insisted Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean his wife stole them. I don&rsquo;t
think that man can fly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda and Dot looked at each other in disappointment.
How awful it would be if they
couldn&rsquo;t bring Sprague to justice! For they
believed that he was responsible for the whole
affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got plenty against the girl&mdash;if
she is the one you&rsquo;re seeking,&rdquo; concluded Jardin.
&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ll get my runabout and drive you
over to their plantation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; interposed Dot. &ldquo;A plane&rsquo;s coming!
Who can it be?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably only some of the coast guards,&rdquo;
explained Jardin, gazing up at the approaching
monoplane. It was the type used by the U. S.
fliers in their patrol about the islands.</p>
<p>Nearer and nearer it whirred; a moment later
it swooped down on the beach a short distance
from them. The pilot climbed out of the cockpit,
and the girls, recognizing him instantly,
uttered a wild cry of joy. It was Bertram
Chase!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bert!&rdquo; they both cried at the same time, as
he rushed forward and seized their hands.
&ldquo;What miracle brought you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found out about your flight at the Honolulu
airport,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;You might know
I&rsquo;d come after you, no matter where you went!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are you doing in Hawaii?&rdquo; demanded
Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sailed from Los Angeles the very night
I left you&mdash;after I put the Ladybug into the
airport. We&rsquo;re on the track of a counterfeiter,
and a clue pointed to Honolulu. Money turned
in at a bank there. So I was sent to Hawaii.
Lucky break for me!&rdquo; He looked admiringly at
Linda.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; exclaimed Dot. &ldquo;Leave
your plane here and come along with us in Mr.
Jardin&rsquo;s car. We think we&rsquo;re going to nab
Linda&rsquo;s double at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Jardin took the wheel of his runabout
and Linda sat beside him. In the rumble-seat
behind, Dot and Bert Chase laughed and talked
excitedly of the adventure.</p>
<p>Over the beach, through lanes that could
hardly be called roads, the little car threaded
its way into the heart of the island. Fifteen
minutes later, within sight of a low, straw-covered
bungalow, it came to a stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Long&rsquo;s place,&rdquo; announced Jardin.
&ldquo;Do you all want to come in with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Dot, her eyes sparkling
with anticipation.</p>
<p>Along a path overgrown with ferns and
flowers, in thick profusion, the little party went
single file to the veranda of the bungalow. Not
a person was in sight; the place looked empty.
Had Sprague and his wife run away again&mdash;or
were they only hiding?</p>
<p>Jardin stepped boldly up to the door and
rapped. A native boy answered his summons
in a minute or two.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>&ldquo;Meester Jardin,&rdquo; he said, with a grin of
welcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your master about?&rdquo; asked the agent.</p>
<p>The boy nodded and beckoned for them to
come inside.</p>
<p>The room to which the door opened was deserted.
A plain, bare room, with only a few
rough chairs, a table, and a hard cot. Not exactly
the kind of place a woman would enjoy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get him,&rdquo; said the boy, indicating for the
visitors to be seated, and going out of the front
door again.</p>
<p>Linda and Dot sat down upon the hard
chairs, but Chase wandered aimlessly around
the room, examining its scanty contents with
curiosity. Another native boy came in with a
pitcher of water, and Jardin inquired for Mrs.
Long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She sick,&rdquo; he explained, briefly, pointing to
another room beyond, and he, too, disappeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>They drank their water, and waited tensely.
Why didn&rsquo;t the man come? Did he suspect
something? Chase continued to walk about the
room, peering with interest, at the closed door
where the girl was supposed to be lying, stopping
now at the table beside a window, and
picking up a little tool that looked like a nut-pick,
that was lodged in a crack between the
table and the window-sill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, Bert?&rdquo; asked Dot idly, not
because she cared about knowing, but just for
something to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a dentist&rsquo;s drill to me,&rdquo; remarked
Jardin, with a shudder.</p>
<p>But Chase was holding it up, examining it
closely, his eyes staring with unbelief. He had
made a discovery!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to investigate this place!&rdquo; he announced,
putting the little instrument into his
pocket. &ldquo;See you later.&rdquo; And he went out of
the front door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what do you suppose&mdash;?&rdquo; began Dot,
but she stopped abruptly, for at that moment a
door at the back opened and Long came into the
room. He, like Jardin, was wearing a linen
suit, and a big hat, but there was no mistaking
the man. As Linda and Dot had insisted, he
was none other than Leslie Sprague!</p>
<p>If he was startled by the sight of the two
aviatrixes, he did not betray the fact by his expression.
Whatever he felt, he covered his surprise by a grin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>&ldquo;Afternoon, Jardin,&rdquo; he said, calmly shaking
hands. &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afternoon, Long,&rdquo; replied the agent, looking
questioningly at the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Leslie Sprague?&rdquo;
asked Dot, triumphantly.</p>
<p>Sprague shrugged his shoulders and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A name I used in connection with moving-pictures,&rdquo;
he explained to Jardin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is your wife, Long?&rdquo; asked the
agent, desirous of getting this business over as
quickly as possible. &ldquo;If she is the girl these
young ladies believe her to be, we have a warrant
for her arrest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Fanny&rsquo;s sick,&rdquo; replied Sprague.
&ldquo;Too bad to arrest her now, when she feels
so rotten.... Besides, it was only a prank.&rdquo;
He looked understandingly at Jardin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A prank!&rdquo; repeated Dot, in disdain. &ldquo;A
prank to steal two planes, chloroform both of
us, and forge a check for five thousand
dollars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sprague laughed uncomfortably.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>&ldquo;You must be mistaken, Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Manton.&rdquo;
He remembered Dot&rsquo;s assumed name,
and took pleasure in using it. &ldquo;Probably Mexican
bandits did that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mexican bandits can&rsquo;t fly planes!&rdquo; returned
Dot, defiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will have to take your wife, Long,&rdquo; interrupted
Jardin. &ldquo;Go in and get her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we arrest him?&rdquo; demanded Dot, resentfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how we can, until we have something
more definite,&rdquo; replied Jardin, who was
evidently an easy-going person, who hated to
suspect anybody. &ldquo;We can hold him as accessory
while his wife is being tried....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped abruptly, for Chase suddenly
opened the door and walked into the room,
dragging a man with him. A hard-looking
fellow, with a sullen expression and a slinking
gait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have found my counterfeiter!&rdquo; Chase announced
triumphantly to Jardin. &ldquo;And this is
his accomplice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still holding the man by the arm, the detective
swung about and pointed his finger at
Sprague.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>&ldquo;Steven Long is the criminal the U. S. Government
has been searching for for a year!
Long, alias Logman, alias Sprague&mdash;&rdquo; He
stopped, and laughed. &ldquo;To think that I saw
this man in the studio of the Apex Film Corporation&mdash;even
tried to help him out&mdash;and
never knew who he was! The joke is on me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve got him now!&rdquo; cried Dot, unable
to restrain her delight.</p>
<p>All eyes were turned upon Sprague. He was
not laughing now. Rather, he was cowering,
deathly pale, holding on to a chair for support.
He did not even demand how Chase had discovered
his secret. But Jardin asked immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was this little instrument I picked up out
of the crack,&rdquo; explained the young detective,
producing the tool that resembled a nut-pick.
&ldquo;I recognized it as an engraver&rsquo;s tool. I wondered
why it should be here. And then I had
an inspiration to search the place. Where
could a counterfeiter work better than here on
this lonely island? Under the guise of a pineapple
planter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is that all the proof you have, Chase?&rdquo;
demanded Jardin, impatiently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not by any means. That was only the beginning.
I wandered about the place till I
found another shack, hidden almost completely
by camouflage. But I got in. And caught this
fellow&mdash;&rdquo; he shook his captive&rsquo;s arm&mdash;&ldquo;in the
act of engraving fifty-dollar bills!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deliberately, then, he reached into his pocket
for two pairs of handcuffs, which he calmly
proceeded to fasten upon the wrists of the two
men. A tense silence lasted while he performed
this operation, a silence which was suddenly
broken by the hysterical wail of a girl.</p>
<p>In a second the closed door of the bedroom
was flung open, and Linda&rsquo;s double dashed into
the room. Sobbing with fright, she threw herself
at Linda&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know I was married to a criminal!&rdquo;
she wailed. &ldquo;Oh, this is the end&mdash;the end of
everything! I wish I was dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaning over, Linda gently raised the girl to
her feet, and for the first time, looked into the
face of her double. The same blue eyes, and
blond, curly hair; a nose not unlike her own,
and a lovely, flower-like complexion. But oh,
how different she looked, with that expression
of terror and misery on her face, and the tears
streaming from her eyes! Like Linda, and yet
totally unlike her!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&mdash;Fanny,&rdquo; whispered Linda.
&ldquo;And try to control yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl did as she was told, and Chase
turned to Jardin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take these men away in your car, Jardin,&rdquo;
he suggested. &ldquo;And come back for the
girls. We&rsquo;ll send a wireless for a boat to come
over from Honolulu and put them into the jail
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all right with you, Miss Carlton?&rdquo;
inquired Jardin. &ldquo;Can you manage Fanny till
we get back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that suits me,&rdquo; agreed Linda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to say good-bye to your husband,
Mrs. Long?&rdquo; asked Chase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never want to see him again!&rdquo; was the
impassioned reply. &ldquo;I hate him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the four men went out, leaving Linda and
Dot alone at last with the girl who had made
so much trouble for them. The girl who had
pretended to be Linda Carlton!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">FANNY&rsquo;S STORY</span></h2>
<p>The three girls sat silently for a few minutes
after the men had left. They heard the
car start, and Fanny heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you hate me,&rdquo; she said, in a pathetic
voice, turning her face towards Linda.
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t believe you can hate me half so
much as I hate Les!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Linda and Dot looked at the girl in
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t have to marry him!&rdquo; Dot
pointed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. But I hadn&rsquo;t found him out then.
I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know anybody could be so awful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; she suggested, &ldquo;we go outside
where it is so much more beautiful&mdash;and hear
your story, Fanny. I&rsquo;d like to know just what
did lead up to your pretending to be me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>The girl jumped to her feet. She didn&rsquo;t seem
sick at all now; in all probability it had only
been nerves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want to get you something
first.&rdquo; And she disappeared into the
bedroom.</p>
<p>In a moment she returned, carrying a heavy
bag in her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your money, Linda,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That
check I cashed. Les made me get it in gold&mdash;I
guess he didn&rsquo;t want the bank numbers traced.
Anyhow, I hid it, and never let him have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she dropped the bag at Linda&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, thank you, Fanny,&rdquo; said Linda, in
surprise. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just leave it here till Mr. Chase
comes back for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to count it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. I believe you,&rdquo; replied Linda.</p>
<p>Tears came into Fanny&rsquo;s eyes. She seized
Linda&rsquo;s hand gratefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sweet of you to say that,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;But you better not leave it here just the same.
You can&rsquo;t trust those native boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; admitted Dot, and picking it up, she
carried it for Linda out of the bungalow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>The girls walked along the path and settled
themselves on the ground amongst the bright
flowers and soft ferns. Now that Fanny had
stopped crying, it was astonishing how much
she resembled Linda. Both Linda and Dot
watched her intently, eager to hear her version
of the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she began, finally, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you first
of all that I&rsquo;m an orphan. I was brought up in
a children&rsquo;s home&mdash;I don&rsquo;t remember my parents
at all. But I had a pretty good education,
and took a business course after I finished high
school. My first job was with an airplane construction
company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yon mean you had a flying job?&rdquo; interrupted
Linda, with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I was a stenographer. But the boss
did give me a chance to learn to fly&mdash;on the
side. But there wasn&rsquo;t any hope of a job in
aviation&mdash;I just worked inside the office for
twenty-five dollars a week. And, like every
other girl in the world, I never had enough
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you work?&rdquo; asked Dot. &ldquo;What
city, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>&ldquo;San Francisco. That was the trouble, I
suppose. Too near Hollywood. I got the craze
to go into pictures. Everybody told me I was
pretty&mdash;and other girls succeeded&mdash;so why
shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; commented Dot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I had some money saved up,&rdquo; continued
Fanny, &ldquo;and I tried to register at all the
studios as an extra. But I soon learned how
impossible it is to get into the movies in times
like these. I couldn&rsquo;t land a thing&mdash;not even a
part in a crowd!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard they&rsquo;re using old actresses and
actors for those parts&mdash;people who used to
be stars&mdash;and even ex-directors,&rdquo; remarked
Linda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true! And even some of those people
can&rsquo;t get anything at all! People with years of
experience go absolutely broke!... Well, my
money dwindled and dwindled until I finally
met Mr. Sprague. Not in a studio&mdash;but at a
party. That was last June&mdash;only a little while
after you made your famous Atlantic Ocean
flight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda nodded, wondering whose idea the
masquerade had been. She asked the question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was Mr. Sprague&rsquo;s,&rdquo; replied Fanny.
&ldquo;He saw the resemblance immediately to your
newspaper pictures, and when he found out I
could fly a plane, he told me I ought to cash in
on it. I thought he was only joking, but he told
me he was serious, and explained how you had
refused movie contracts at enormous salaries....
Well, he kept after me, and when I found
that I wasn&rsquo;t getting any parts, and that my
money was all gone and even my old job in San
Francisco, I gave in and promised to try it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Les planned everything&mdash;even rehearsed
with me how I was to talk to Mr. Von Goss.
And it was he who pushed through the aviation
picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Von Goss was lovely&mdash;he never asked
me for any proofs of my identity at all, just
signed me up for the picture, and it was Les
who made me insist on the enormous salary. I
acted stubborn, like Greta Garbo, and I got it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then Les proposed to me. Told me
that he&rsquo;d invest my money, and give up his job
at the studio and come over here to Hawaii to
live after we were married. He said he had a
plantation here, and that I&rsquo;d never be discovered
as the girl who pretended to be Linda
Carlton. Oh, Les can be very charming if he
tries, and he made me think we&rsquo;d live on this
island paradise in a perpetual honeymoon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you had no idea that he was also involved
in anything that was crooked?&rdquo; asked
Linda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Absolutely none. I just thought that
the masquerade was a clever trick, that
wouldn&rsquo;t really hurt anybody, because you had
refused movie contracts.... Well, to get back
to the story.... Everything went well till you
girls appeared. Of course we were prepared
for that&mdash;Les had thought it all out ahead of
time, in case you ever did show up. I came
back to Los Angeles, as you know, in a hired
plane, and was just about to land when Les
gave me the pre-arranged signal not to come
down. You remember&mdash;waving his hat on the
field?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda nodded, though she had hardly noticed
it at the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I flew off and landed an hour later at Culver
City. And he pushed the rehearsals right
through, and the next morning he told me to go
right to the Los Angeles airport and demand
your autogiro. We&rsquo;d only borrow it, he said,
to get away. I believed him, and did it, for I
was anxious to be married and out of the country.
We flew to Mexico, as you know, and got married.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I guess you know the rest. How we
circled about you when we found out you were
chasing us&mdash;and how we changed planes. But
you don&rsquo;t know that Les made me fly that Sky
Rocket at the point of a pistol. He seemed to
change then and there into a demon, and he had
me frightened to death. Of course I realized
what a horrible mistake it had been to marry
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he seemed nice again when we sailed
on that boat, but when I actually saw you girls
fly over the Pacific Ocean, it was too much for
me. We recognized the Sky Rocket, and knew
you were after us. I wanted to give up then,
but Les said nobody would ever find us here at
Lanai....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t you know that he was a counterfeiter,
after you lived here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not. I never knew till this
afternoon. Of course I&rsquo;d often seen that man
before&mdash;the one that the detective caught&mdash;but
I thought he was just the overseer. Les has
always been away from here most of the time,
so he needed somebody to manage the plantation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is there much of a plantation?&rdquo; asked
Linda, suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess not,&rdquo; admitted Fanny. &ldquo;We do
raise a few pineapples. But I never saw any
great quantities. And there are only a couple
of native boys working here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you won&rsquo;t have to worry about your
marriage, anyhow. So long as Sprague married
you under a false name, and in Mexico besides,
I guess it can easily be annulled. You
won&rsquo;t have to see him again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fanny was silent, worn out with the tension
of telling her story. Stretching back, she
buried her face in the ferns. Linda and Dot
looked at each other in hopeless dismay. Here
was the girl whom Linda had threatened to
prosecute to the uttermost, completely in her
power, and she felt only sympathy for her!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor kid!&rdquo; said Dot, feelingly, as if
Fanny were years younger than she was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know it&rsquo;s my own fault,&rdquo; said Fanny,
with a suppressed sob. &ldquo;It was acting a lie in
the beginning. But I never dreamed it would
lead to anything like this. I thought if you&mdash;the
real Linda Carlton&mdash;ever did appear, I&rsquo;d
just hand over the money, and maybe you&rsquo;d
give me back part of it for my work in the
picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Linda, &ldquo;that we have to
learn for ourselves that deceit never pays. But
somehow, I can&rsquo;t be hard on you, Fanny. And
I&rsquo;ll tell you why. It&rsquo;s because of the very first
thing you told us&mdash;that you are an orphan. It&rsquo;s
so much more difficult if you haven&rsquo;t parents to
teach you. I&mdash;haven&rsquo;t a mother&mdash;but I have a
wonderful father and a loving aunt.... So,
somehow, I just feel as if I hadn&rsquo;t the right to
judge you....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without raising her head from the ground,
Fanny groped blindly for Linda&rsquo;s hand. And
found it and pressed it gratefully.</p>
<p>The sound of a motor in the distance made
the girls glance towards the lane. The car was
returning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with me?&rdquo; asked
Fanny, plaintively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take you with us, of course,&rdquo; replied
Linda. &ldquo;You can fly with Mr. Chase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;when we get to Honolulu&mdash;shall I
have to go to jail?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>Linda hesitated a moment and looked at Dot.
But her companion, usually so relentless in seeing
that justice was done, had evidently softened
too. She, also, felt a great sympathy for
Fanny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; said Linda. &ldquo;I think
you&rsquo;ve suffered enough, Fanny. You&rsquo;ve returned
my money, and both planes, and if you&rsquo;ll
return Mr. Von Goss&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; interrupted the girl. &ldquo;Les took
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;ll be made to return it. So&mdash;if
you&rsquo;ll promise to be good, I think we&rsquo;ll let you
go free&mdash;if Mr. Chase can fix it up with the
police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s blue eyes opened wide with appreciation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really mean that, Linda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are wonderful! So generous! So
clever, too!&rdquo; She lowered her eyelids. &ldquo;And
to think I ever dared to pretend I could be
you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>Linda flushed in embarrassment at this
praise&mdash;from the girl she had been regarding
as her worst enemy. Luckily she did not need
to say anything, for the car had stopped now,
and Jardin, who had returned alone, was
getting out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left Chase with the two prisoners,&rdquo; he
explained. &ldquo;Now you girls climb in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oughtn&rsquo;t we to say something to the native
boys who work here?&rdquo; asked Fanny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come back and talk to them later,&rdquo; replied
Jardin. &ldquo;After Long tells me what he
wants to do with the plantation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ride back to the beach consumed only
fifteen minutes, but Linda realized when she got
there that the afternoon was gone. So much
time had been spent at the plantation, waiting
around, first for Sprague, and then for the return
of Jardin. Though it was still bright sunlight,
her watch indicated six o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had better send a wireless to our hostess,&rdquo;
she said to Dot. &ldquo;To let her know that
we can&rsquo;t be back in time for dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her chum nodded dismally. Another festivity
passed up! But it had been worth while
this time, for at last their purpose was accomplished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>Linda proceeded to send the wireless from the
Sky Rocket, and then returned to the agent&rsquo;s
shack, where Chase was still sitting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you take Fanny,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;and
when you get to Honolulu see whether you can
have that warrant for her arrest nullified? We
are dropping the charges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young detective stared at Linda in incredulous
amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really mean it?&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>Linda laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, though. Fanny returned the money&mdash;and
is sorry, so we&rsquo;re forgiving her. That&rsquo;s all
there is to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stand there and tell me you&rsquo;re letting
that girl off, after flying four thousand miles,
over land and ocean, to capture her?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>Linda nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because Linda&rsquo;s a Christian!&rdquo; retorted
Dot, exasperated at the delay. &ldquo;But I warn
you, Bert, I won&rsquo;t show Christian spirit
towards you, if you don&rsquo;t stop talking and get
a move on pretty soon. Do you realize we&rsquo;re
starved&mdash;and we&rsquo;ve got almost two hours&rsquo;
flight before we get any food?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>Chase grinned, and started towards the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re willing to wait an hour,&rdquo; suggested
Jardin, &ldquo;I can take you all to my bungalow
for supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, Mr. Jardin,&rdquo; replied Linda.
&ldquo;We want to be on our way&mdash;and fly while it is
light. We&rsquo;ll set off immediately. Fanny, you
go with Mr. Chase. Come on, everybody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your other name, Fanny?&rdquo; asked
Chase, as the group walked along the beach to
the planes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Preston,&rdquo; replied the girl, with a sigh of
relief at the thought of dropping the name of
Sprague&mdash;or Long&mdash;forever.</p>
<p>The Sky Rocket took off first, and five minutes
later Chase&rsquo;s monoplane left the island.
Within sight of each other, the two planes flew
across the Pacific in the glorious light of the
sunset, and arrived at the Honolulu airport
without any disaster, a little after eight
o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br /><span class="small">CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p>Leaving the planes at the airport, the four
young people ate supper together at a quick-lunch
restaurant in Honolulu. Here they discussed
their plans concerning Fanny Preston.</p>
<p>Linda insisted that the girl live at one of the
smaller hotels, on some of the gold pieces
which she had returned that afternoon, and
though Fanny protested, she had no money of
her own, and no place to go, so she finally had
to agree. In the meantime, Chase promised to
work for her release.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then we&rsquo;ll take you back to Los Angeles
with us when we go,&rdquo; Linda concluded.
&ldquo;And try to find you a job.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>There were tears in Fanny&rsquo;s eyes when Linda
and Dot finally left her at the hotel and took a
taxi to the Governor&rsquo;s mansion. Here they
offered profuse apologies to their hostess&mdash;apologies
which she dismissed with a smile.
She was delighted to learn that the counterfeiting
menace had been checked, for news of
this crime had been in the papers for more than
a year. She felt that Linda and Dot had
helped in a big service for both Hawaii and the
United States, but the girls insisted that the
honors were for Bertram Chase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for our telegrams!&rdquo; exclaimed Linda.
&ldquo;Oh, I do so hope there is one from father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I received one from your father, Miss Carlton,&rdquo;
announced her hostess. &ldquo;From Los Angeles.
He and your aunt are sailing tomorrow
for Honolulu. And two young men are with
them&mdash;I have forgotten their names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was one of them Jim&mdash;I mean James&mdash;Valier?&rdquo;
asked Dot, eagerly.</p>
<p>The older woman smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe so,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And a Ralph somebody.
Would that be right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; agreed Dot, with immense
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, in view of that news,&rdquo; continued the
Governor&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;I think we will plan a big
dinner for the night they arrive. It takes four
days, you know, from Los Angeles. I hope
we can keep you amused until then.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we love it here!&rdquo; cried Linda. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
the most beautiful spot in the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, although Linda was anxious to see her
own family and the two boys, the time nevertheless
passed pleasantly. They went to the
famous Waikiki beach every morning, and
swam in the water that seemed like velvet, or
rode in the launches and speed boats. After
luncheon they drove about the beautiful island
visiting the marvellous aquarium, with its gorgeous
fish of all colors and descriptions, or
viewing the mountains and the coral formations;
and in the evening they would watch the
glorious sunsets over the ocean and then dance
or bathe in the moonlight. One lovely afternoon
Linda and Dot took Fanny and flew to the
island of Kauai, and saw the Waimea Canyon
and the Barking Sands, and the rocky, jagged
cliffs, and the beaches and parks in all their
beauty. And one evening Bert Chase went
with them on another flight, for he had managed
to have his stay at Hawaii extended, since
he had successfully completed his work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>And so the great day came when the boat
from Los Angeles docked at Pearl Harbor.
Linda and Dot were at the wharf half an hour
before it was scheduled to arrive, so impatient
were they to see their folks from home.</p>
<p>A great surging joy swelled up in Linda&rsquo;s
throat at the sight of her father as he came
forward to meet her. It was so suffocating that
for a moment she couldn&rsquo;t say a word of greeting.
Breathless, she flew into his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daughter!&rdquo; he said, in a tone filled with
emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy, darling!&rdquo; she managed to stammer,
and then, recovering herself somewhat, she
kissed her aunt and shook hands with the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations, congratulations, and then
some!&rdquo; exclaimed Jim, to both of the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was great, Linda!&rdquo; cried Ralph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Linda and Dot,&rsquo; if you please,&rdquo; corrected
Linda. &ldquo;Dot did every bit as much as I did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact, I flew nearer the ocean,&rdquo; added her
chum, mischievously. &ldquo;So near that I almost
drowned us both!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell us about the dangers&mdash;now that
you have miraculously escaped with your
lives!&rdquo; begged Miss Carlton, with a shiver.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>And then everybody talked at once, asking
questions, making explanations, accounting for
all the time since they had seen each other.
The girls drove right to the hotel with the
party, and here Linda dragged out Fanny and
introduced her, much to Miss Carlton&rsquo;s amazement.
And then she actually asked her aunt to
look after the girl for the rest of the visit, until
they should all go back to Los Angeles together.</p>
<p>The dinner at the Governor&rsquo;s mansion that
night was another gorgeous affair. All the
celebrities of the island were invited, as well as
Linda&rsquo;s friends. Even Fanny Preston was included,
and Bertram Chase was accorded a seat
of honor on Linda&rsquo;s right, with Ralph Clavering
on her left&mdash;an arrangement which made
Ralph exceedingly jealous, for Chase managed
to absorb most of her attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to go into the secret service,
Linda,&rdquo; he said, earnestly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d be a marvellous
detective. Have you signed up for
anything for the winter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had expected to teach,&rdquo; replied the aviatrix.
&ldquo;But I guess it&rsquo;s too late for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, don&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p>Chase wasn&rsquo;t eating at all, instead he was
fumbling with his fork, as if he were terribly
nervous. Linda noticed his queer actions, and
wondered what could be the cause of them, for
he had always seemed to have such easy, pleasant
manners. But his next question, abrupt as
it was, offered the explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a funny place&mdash;and a funny time&mdash;to
ask you, Linda,&rdquo; he began, very low &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m
so afraid you&rsquo;ll fly away and I&rsquo;ll never see you
again.... You see&mdash;I&rsquo;m crazy about you. I
love you! I want you to marry me, and fly
everywhere with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faltering as his speech was at first, he ended
it very fast, as if he had to finish with one
breath. Out of the corner of her eye, Linda
could see his hand trembling; this fearless flier,
who dared all sorts of dangers! Why, he
seemed to be afraid to look in her face!</p>
<p>Linda, too, was embarrassed; she didn&rsquo;t
know what to say. She liked him so much that
she couldn&rsquo;t bear to hurt his feelings, yet marriage
was out of the question at this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I appreciate it a lot, Bert,&rdquo; she finally replied,
softly. &ldquo;But&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t. Not now, anyway,&rdquo;
she added, so as not to seem too abrupt.
&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t see
me often. Distance isn&rsquo;t anything to fliers.
And I&rsquo;ll talk to you later about the secret
service.&rdquo; She paused, nodding in Ralph&rsquo;s direction....
&ldquo;This impatient boy on my left is
having a fit. I must talk to him now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>She turned to the latter, sulking as usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old friends are a nuisance when we have
a new crush, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; he asked, bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ralph, behave yourself!&rdquo; she commanded.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t spoil my party by getting peeved!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Linda,&rdquo; he said, penitently. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t mean it. Only I just know that guy has
fallen for you. What was he talking to you so
long about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda blushed. &ldquo;He wants me to go into
secret service flying,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would! And then get you to marry him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda laughed, as if to imply that what Ralph
suggested was nonsense. If he only knew how
near to the point he had come!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, are you going to do it?&rdquo; he persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. First I&rsquo;m going to get my
Ladybug at Los Angeles&mdash;and fly home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladybug, Ladybug, fly away home!&rdquo; quoth
Ralph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will!&rdquo; promised Linda, smiling. But
she did not say how long she would stay there.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
